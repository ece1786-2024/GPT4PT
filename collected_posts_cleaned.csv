ESTJ,"So, most other forums has one like this, but I couldn't find one here.

(think we'll need one regarding all the stereotypes here...)
So guys (and girls), just go on and shoot any questions you'd like!
(other ESTJs are welcome to answer as well of course, but I guess you don't need an invitation for that..)"
ESTJ,"Hmm, hard one (haven't thoutht that much about it since I'm 17..) but I'll try.
I think I'll take a few strong and obvious rules, a lot of freedom, surrounded by a lot of love all the time. *note to self: not being too protective*
Does that count as a rule? It was kinda three..."
ESTJ,"Oh, I love my Ne! It makes me able to see almost everything from different angles (or forces me to draw connections and think of poasibilities that doesn't exist when I'm down). It's also the fun part of me, allowing me to be more spontanious and abstract. It allows me to see the big and often abstract picture of things, and then narrow it down to the more focused view of Si, making it possible to work with. Also taking the narrow view of Si, making it bigger and more all-covering. Most important thing I can think of now is to see things from different angles.
Ne is one of the functions I enjoy the most, and I'd like it to be stronger."
ESTJ,"1. Depends. As it is now, I usually see the logic behind it. If I can't see the logic, of if I'm mentaly down, I take it a lot more serious. My Ne kicks in and I imagine every possible reason to why they would be ignoring me. To solve the problem, I'd talk to them, ask why they ignored me, etc.

2. If it's suppoused to be realistic, I hate it. I'll comment on it, and then I'll leave it there and continue to whach the movie.

3. Hmm. I play League of Legends. Just when I have someone to play with, I find it very boring to play alone. I'm here quite a bit, enjoy reading fantasy books a lot, watching videos of different fighting styles and military strategies, etc."
ESTJ,"1. I can agree on them. If I can decide for myself what ""guardian"" would stand for, I'd love it. Now, guardian has the vibe of guarding old traditions and customs, the law, the goverment, etc. I do not think this is the case. On the other hand, if it would stand for guarding the rights of people, freedom of opinion etc, then I'll agree. Supervisor is okey I guess. As long as you don't put too much weight in any of them.

"
ESTJ,"I believe that everyone has the same worth, but again I'm a subjective human being, and therefore value people different. So rather than saying that I judge the worth of people, I'd say I judge their worth to me, and what they can contribute with to me and to the society. If they don't do what they're assigned on time, that would decrease this. If they hinder the progression of things by being plain stupid, things like that. But still, it doesn't decrease their actual worth or value, just how I view them.

Something I'd consider a great act of kindness would be something you do for another person for the reason of helping them in some way, and not expecting something in return, even in form of recognition for what they've done."
ESTJ,"@Dumaresq,

I think that the monetary worth of someone would be their current capital added with a scalar multiplied by their potential capital in the future. However, a person's worth to me is completely subjective, and thus a general consensus would be difficult to achieve. I personally think that people are invaluable in a personal sense, replaceable in an industrial sense, and in comparison to others, equal. I sometimes have difficulty empathizing with those who have lost a loved one, because 1) ESTJs just aren't very empathetic, and 2) Many people die every day. It's a fact of life. Move on, even if it's hard.

I consider a great act of kindness to be one in which the one who acted served another without an expectation or recognition, praise, thanks, or something in return. Secondly, but perhaps more significantly, spending time with someone. We all have a truly very limited time here on Earth, and when someone is willing to spend a lot of it with you, even in your down times, then that person has shown you great kindness."
ESTJ,"1. I don't have a particular interest in watching sports or e-sports. I'm rather indifferent about the subject, except when it comes to the SF Giants. Strongly dislike them.

3. I have no opinion about fanatic fans. If that's your passion, go for it. Just don't get violent or destroy property that's not your own.


4. I'd like to be involved in Phase 1 (making the idea) and in control of Phase 2. I like helping conceive plans, but I especially love bringing them into reality. Phase 2 is an area where I get to be both innovative and analytical at the same time; it's pretty much the perfect yin-yang I like in a job.

Phase three (the physical labour) would interest me on a knowledge level, but not a practical one. I'd like to know the general process of cabinet making, but I don't want to make the cabinets."
ESTJ,"I think it's pretty even, can't really say that either bad or good memories dominates. The sense that dominates is sight, clearly. Also impressions, what I thought about things, how I felt about them, etc."
ESTJ,"Hanging out with friends, playing league of legends, reading, training, listening to music, watching youtube videos about ancient military strategies. Oh, and I just started making a viking shield."
ESTJ,I had a coronary just reading that.
ESTJ,"@Epicyclic

I hate the fourth phase. Maintenance of anything is mental death for me."
ESTJ,"@Dumaresq - We hate it, but if we have to, we will do it. Not unlike some other types who just can't bear to do it or think it too mundane for them to bother.

So we try to manage the system such that maintanence issues like these are kept to a minimum."
ESTJ,"

If you put me in position where I just had to maintain something, it wouldn't get done unless my continued existence depended on it.

So I dunno about you, but check me off for the ""can't bear to do it"" box."
ESTJ,"I liked the video, personally! One of the better descriptions of our type I've ever seen. Like many of us I'm sure have said, we're much like ENTJs except that instead of percolating theory, we're much more concerned with making things happen tangibly, in the real world. Thus the much fewer number of ESJs, particularly ESTJs, on the forum.

1. I'd agree with @WickedQueen , I excelled in school and still do. Academic settings suit me for the most part, although I have to say now that I've been interacting directly with patients for so long, I don't think I could go back to a straight-up 'objective' job in health care. I did have many decent friends and still do, and while it's harder for me to make close friends now, I suspect that is more enneagram subtype than MBTI. I am perfectly capable of getting along with and working alongside most people in terms of MTBI leanings.
I struggle when it comes to 'empathizing with fools', as well as 'social patience', according to my husband. He counts it as a struggle that I am 'not entertained by people acting stupidly' and that 'when people would see someone skateboarding down the street carrying a second person other people would look at it and be like 'wow hahahaha that's so silly' and you'd be like 'those fucking idiots'.
....... I guess that's a problem? Who fucking knew.
2. Same, sometimes I have things in common, other times now. Most of the time I find the themes of my interests the same as ESTJs around my own age, and the younger or much older ones to be completely incomprehensible (or at least very visibly immature)
3. Be inconsistent or brush me off are the more minor ones. They're the ones that will make me think you are an idiot and nullify any opinion beyond 'neutral' I had of a person. Acting as though I am incompetent without assessing my abilities or treating me as incompetent in general will make me envision ways to make your life a living fucking hell from now until you're nothing to me.
4. I tend to look at the enneagram forums a lot, as I enjoy that theory of PT. I like the polls and health and fitness as well. Otherwise, I'm just here there and everywhere."
ESTJ,"
Excel with: I don't have much problem at school, always among Top 10 in class, always chosen as class administrator, joined lots of clubs, had decent friends. I was a responsible child, my parents trusted me more than my older brother. I took care of household when they were at work.
Struggle: Because I'm a responsible person and never complain, my friends, siblings, teachers, and parents dropped most of the heavy burden and responsibility on my shoulder. They didn't care about my feelings because they think I can handle everything. But actually I was very upset because I feel used, exploited, and abandoned. Maybe that is why I have a lot of anger. I was very fiery and everybody was afraid of me.


Sometimes yes, sometimes not.

I'm human, treat me like a human. Just because I don't cry, doesn't mean I'm not sad. Just because I act cruel, doesn't mean I cannot empathize. Just because I don't show it, doesn't mean I don't have feelings. I do feel, but I have priorities other than following my emotional drive.


I used to wandering around."
ESTJ,"This is bookmarked.
Really nice video, for most part, I seem to agree with him. I think it's kind of like I thought in the beginning, when I started to dive in to MBTI, but later drifted away from. It's very interesting, I really have to watch that again. Thanks for sharing it!"
ESTJ,"Personally I never have and never will use 'because I said so' as an argument 'winner', period. People that do so infuriate me and I frankly find them laughable at the same time. If you can't present proof, get the hell out.

In terms of moral arguments, separate from ethical arguments in my mind, I really don't care what anyone's position is as long as they're not asserting what they believe as the truth (and I do not do so either- I may believe others' ideas as 'wrong' but I'll never tell them my way is best, either) to others, particularly children, or using their beliefs to harm others or infringe on their rights.... who cares? Why waste the energy arguing with those people?

I have hyper-religious family all over my dad's side, including my father, and at the end of the day it's like... thank god you guys are gonna be dead soon so you can stop telling 13 year olds they're going to hell for getting raped. I know they love me, and I know they genuinely believe they are doing 'the right thing', and no amount of arguing is going to change that so I don't bother. I just keep myself as far away from that as possible and refuse to corroborate or take part in their statements about those matters.

That seems to really madden people, but I just can't be assed.

A particular example that comes to mind was a young person in a skype MBTI chat I was in for a while. They asserted quite strongly that pedophilia was unlike any other fetish and we only regarded it as morally wrong because we didn't 'trust children' to 'make their own choices'.

I work in nursing. I've seen 11 year olds be declared 'competent' to keep diagnosis information from their parents. Doesn't mean I think a 30 year old fucking a 12 year old is normal, it never has been, never will be, and there is zero biological basis for it whatsoever. Children can be declared competent, SOME OF THEM, but no child under 10 is capable of consenting to intercourse if for no other reason than their bodies can't fucking take it.

I presented this person with studies, evidence, my own long experience dealing with children who were victims of sexual abuse, teens who were 'willing' participants of underaged sex and now in twice-weekly therapy, etc etc. But nope. It's a 'normal fetish'.

Again, why bother? Somebody's bound to knock that person out sooner or later, and it makes no difference to me what some idiot 18 year old believes. No energy to waste arguing with a moron like that. Have your morals all you want but accept facts or you're a joke, regardless of where in the 'hierarchy' you are to me or how well I know you."
ESTJ,"
I'm usually very tolerant regarding moral differences. Perhaps I will lose some respect for the person in question, but I will rarely try to convince them to think the same way I do (though I likely wish that they did).


I may be somewhat forceful with relatives, simply because I'm more at ease with them and know their established moral stances well. It will probably result in a fervent argument from my side defending my points. On the other hand, if they happen to be someone I don't know well, I'll be less sure in myself and more inclined to listen to their point of view. With teachers or professors, though, I'll probably let it pass. As said, I'm generally tolerant of beliefs different from my own, so I won't feel too upset if they still end up disagreeing with me.


I don't have kids, but if I did I would probably refrain from using the ""because I said so"" argument entirely. Perhaps it's dominant Te or just an idiosyncrasy of mine, but I expect good reasons for thinking the way you do."
ESTJ,"

ESTJs are just as open, affectionate & loving as other human beings. Forget the stereotypes of robotic personality, the mean step parent that ruined juniors childhood & the prick supervisor that makes you work on Saturdays. Those are likely unhealthy examples of every type rather than those ESTj & ENTJ meanies LOL.

Seriously though, ESTJs are much harder on themselves than anybody else in their life & I highly doubt the accuracy of those poor abused souls that assume their nemesis is an ESTJ."
ESTJ,"When people ask for my time under the pretense of having me help them solve something, only for them to use it as an opportunity to endlessly complain.

Doesn't happen anymore, but happened a lot in my earlier years."
ESTJ,"

Don't worry, I wouldn't stereotype them like that. Even though I like to do it sometimes, jokingly ESTJs are cool:] In fact, I have been in love with an ESTJ for some time now and he and I are thinking of starting a serious relationship. And the INFJ I am, I have to prepare and think about all the possibilities. Even the robot-like one Thanks for answering!^.^"
ESTJ,Just ask him? He'll know his own preferences better than any strangers.
ESTJ,"Depends what you mean by 'no work'. I work hard and play hard. If I had no job and still had the same income I'd be writing books, traveling, making extra cash regardless.

I'd rather be formally occupied but I only say that now because I'm going into a field I endlessly enjoy doing AND will get paid handsomely for. If it weren't for the money I would never work a job I'd be bored with again, period, and I get bored of any job roughly 25 minutes after I master the tasks around it."
ESTJ,"Not a female, but I'll try to come with some input. Do you know what her love language is? In the case of flowers and that kind of gifts, I think that matters more than type. Also, I'm sure she understood what you meant with them (judging from her answers.)
For how long have you given her space? Have you talked at all during that time?
This is just a theory, but I'll go for it. She might be ""testing"" you, and see if you actually care enough.
If she is an ESTJ, I'd recomend you to ask her. It seems very un-ESTJish to end something this way. So even though it may be hard, try to ask her. You'll probably get a straight on answer."
ESTJ,"

Skimmed the Socialism thread. I am more agreed with SilverFalcon's position than TheSonderer.

My agreement is based on my observations and my political science education."
ESTJ,"So, most other forums has one like this, but I couldn't find one here.

(think we'll need one regarding all the stereotypes here...)
So guys (and girls), just go on and shoot any questions you'd like!
(other ESTJs are welcome to answer as well of course, but I guess you don't need an invitation for that..)"
ESTJ,"Carl Jung said that attempts to bring the lower functions into conscious thought will result in nothing but grief.

Socionics, on the other hand, says talk to a Ne dom/aux. In theory, they'll rub off on you."
ESTJ,"I am always infinitely more irritated by Ti-aux users than anyone else on the planet. Ti-doms on the other hand, I tend to greatly enjoy and have reasonably good friendships with several. ETP males under 30 make me seriously debate whether it'd be worth going to prison for murder if it meant getting them to finally shut up. Again, not an issue for the ones I know over 30, they're pretty bomb. ETP young women don't tend to bother me either.

Fe only 'bothers' me in that I find it comes off quite disingenuously in conversation. I have several close friends who are Fe doms and once you get past that veneer, it's all good. Fi dom/aux doesn't bother me but again, over 22 or bust. Under that they can be pretty intolerable."
ESTJ,"

So, as people with Ni PoLR, I was wondering if you have a strong distaste for sarcasm? Sarcasm being when someone says something but actually means something completely different.

I want to post some examples of people who have used sarcasm to get famous, and I want to know your impressions:


^Sarah uses it off and on.


^Aubrey uses it for nearly everything she says."
ESTJ,"I fucking love sarcastic humour, to a point. I think if you're trying to actually accomplish something through a point as a positive... let me rephrase. If you are trying to make a positive point in an argument or a positive point against a negative with humour, doing it with sarcasm is going to fall flat. Sarah Silverman is a great example. I fucking love her as an actress, she has got the straight-up take no shit style that I adore, but excess sarcasm to try and make a point is just irritating. There are better ways to do it.

Not that he's a great example, but my husband is an Se-Ni user, an ESFP. My best friend of 15 years, 5 years longer than I've known my husband, is an INTJ. I get along with ENFJs to a certain degree and do alright-ish with INFJs. ENTJs tend to get on my nerves but that's because the ones I know are young men. Any male under 20 and ENTX gets on my nerves.

I don't really get the POLR thing. I haven't studied socionics to any degree, but I get along with people who use Ni just fine as long as they're not off into completely ridiculous social theory to explain why they have no friends."
ESTJ,"Hm... I like to read in general, but usually I don't have enough time to do it frequently...
I also have a very weird taste in books, which makes it difficult for me to find something I like. ^^""
Generally I like stories with lots of morbid humor, dystopian scenarios and sometimes dark fantasy.
I also really enjoy books, which depict the feelings of insane characters or the deepness of a character in general.
One of my favourite authors is Walter Moers who wrote, for example, this treasure here:
Rumo and His Miraculous Adventures"
ESTJ,"I actually hate when people ask me this because I *don't* feel organized. ""How do you keep your house so clean?"" ""How do you write an essay so fast?"" ""Why are your notes legible?""

Because I develop a system and I stick to it. I do my dishes every morning when I get up before I make breakfast, I clean my kitchen and bathroom every Sunday. Ergo, my apartment isn't a general stye like most of my friends'. I can write essays fast because I've written over 1000 at this point; my system is really good and efficient.

It's second nature to us, and awareness of the first function's use tends to be sort of poor, so I'm curious to see what answers you get. If I'm 'organized' compared to most people I can't even imagine what it'd be like to live like them XD"
ESTJ,"I'm not extraverted by 'layman's terms' and I can't say I've met an ESTJ who is. I can very much appear extraverted when I'm at work- you have to communicate to succeed at your tasks and be effective, and the joking around and helping people is just good for morale and building relationships with people! I enjoy working with others over working alone most of the time... like I'd rather work on a solitary task in the presence of others than work on it totally isolated, but there are exceptions too.

I get burnt out spending too much time with people. I'm not much of one for initiating hanging out with others, but if I'm invited to something I'll usually go and have a great time.

My social life tends to be pretty segregated too, like I've got friends I hang out with in groups because it's fun and we can party, then I have the friends I hang out with one on one or maybe 3 of us (who are usually my closer friends), there's acquaintances... People I know through organizations I'm a member or volunteer with that I only see there, classmates (99% of them I don't hang out with outside of school) and workmates (same deal).

Among the people I wouldn't hang out with outside of where we met, I can apparently appear pretty reserved and uninterested in forming stronger relationships... it's not intentional, but it pretty much is how I feel so I guess that works out.

Regardless, don't let the E in Te put you off. The dominant function being externally focused has no bearing on your social orientation in function theory. They are related for plenty of people, but it's not a rule they be the same."
ESTJ,"Man, sorry I haven't answered yet...
If I'm having a bad day, I usually want one of two things. Either I want to talk about it, even though sometimes it takes some lingering to make me talk about what troubles me. If that's not the case, I want to do something I enjoy with people I enjoy. It's often hard to tell which though (I think).
I hope that helped at least a bit. If there's any more questions you have, don't hesitate to ask."
ESTJ,"I listen to music.

"
ESTJ,"You already know the answer to this.

If you pick the wrong answer, well, the only one who has to live with your own close mindedness is you."
ESTJ,"Gah, double post because of internet problems :dry:"
ESTJ,"We actually have one here. Not sticky though, maybe we should try to get it sticked? I've no idea how that's done though..."
ESTJ,"I didn't see that. I think we need to call the moderators to do so. @Pucca or @Pifanjr, can we have Pinina's thread stickied and this one deleted so all PerC cafe members can easily access it?"
ESTJ,Continuous Te and the force of Fi if I'm correct.
ESTJ,"I'll do this exclusivly on the impression I have from one ENTP and one INTP. (and throw in some other stuff as well)

I like ENTPs, and I'm not a big fan of INTPs. There's too much Ti for my taste."
ESTJ,I think I'm generally attracted to ENTPs. Something about them... Not too knowledgeable with INTPs.
ESTJ,"Okay, thanks.

Spend more time on the INTP forum, and you might know some more about us."
ESTJ,"ESTJs project energy when they speak. ITSJs seem to maintain energy when they speak (unless they're with really good friends, at which point it can be difficult to tell them apart)."
ESTJ,"Hello ESTJs! I am doing a survey on MBTI types and hobbies, and I want to see if there is a correlation, and I need some ESTJ input. Would greatly appreciate it, thanks! I will put up the results in the MBTI main forum after I get enough responses

ESTJ,Done.
ESTJ,"Tsubaki said:
Also, @TopCatLSD, if he wants ^^
Man, I was a fuckin idiot when I was a kid. My parents used too worry about my health a lot.

When I was a baby still sleeping in the crib, my parents had given me my own room and put me right next to the window. Apparently I used to climb out of the crib and onto the window sill and stare outside, my parents found me dangling my feet out the window trying to escape (<thanks mom & dad) I did it so often that they eventually gave my room to my sis and made me sleep in their room so they could supervise me. When I was little I also had a habit of hiding in my house until my parents would cry cause they thought they lost me, then I'd burst out like ""SURPRISE BITCH!!""

When I started going to school, I was constantly one of the most obnoxious kids in the class room. I was constantly making noise and trying to make my classmates laugh. My teachers hated me. Looking back I was probably a huge disappointment to me ESFJ dad, he always wanted us to be the most successful out of everyone in our peer group, but I would fail every academic subject and couldn't for my life concentrate in the classroom. I was also really possessive of girls I had crushes on (I think I still am, actually) if I saw any guy talking to them, I'd jump in and be like ""Uh, no bitch! She's mine.""

My 12 year old life was probably the darkest point in my life. I was part of an underground fight club with me and my main group of friends. I was cool with the skater table, the black table, and the ****** table <well, the NOT as ghetto ****** table. (I'm hispanic, I can say that). We used to get like thirty people at a time to show up and watch our fights, it was so much fun. We used to plan fights like a day ahead of time and text out witch bathroom or hallway we where going to host it in. My job was to ""charm"" the campus supervisors into letting us go into the most empty parts of school, I'd say ""We need to go to Mr.Whatshisfaces room, we'll be quick"" or my favorite ""Oh campus supervisor #2 I almost didn't notice you got your hair done, it looks nice!"" Cause there was so many of us, we had to brake into squads and use different paths to get their, my squad always had the easiest getting in. We also had a Youtube channel where we would post the fights, but it got taken down by the cops...

After that was over I got to go home to my bipolar INFP mum whom I was living with; I'll spare the details. My parents where going through divorce, so all she could afford was a broken down piece of shit house with cockroaches and a falling roof. She would come home every night sobbing her eyes out, depressed. It was my responsibility to care for her emotionally. It felt like I was parenting her, and not the other way around. I legit feel sorry for any parents who have INFP kids, It's absolutely miserable.

^So if you're noticing a trend, I was an incredibly Se heavy kid who grew up in an Ne-Fe heavy world.

Did I just write my life story? Wtf?"
ESTJ,"This is not a question, but I have met a really hot ESTJ guy who is very nice. Probably won't go anywhere romantic, but I found it amusing, since I spend lots of time over here."

ESTJ,"@Lucyyy I wrote an answer to your question a day ago, but it disappeared. Do you still want me to answer your original post, or are you happy with the answer you've gotten? If you want, it wouldn't be a problem.
Anyways, good luck! Feel free to rush in here with more questions whenever you want to!"
ESTJ,Yes please. I'd appreciate it if you shared your opinion :happy:
ESTJ,"Depends on the reason why I dislike them, and how serious it is, so it's hard to just give an overall answer. I probably wouldn't go ""I don't like you"", but rather tell what I didn't like about them. Also, I wouldn't hang out with them much.
Could you specify the question?"
ESTJ,sry but idk how else to phrase it . . .

ESTJ,"I have no idea what I'm studying. All I know is not theater or art or anything like that. I want to learn programming and get a math minor, but other than that, everything is wide open, because I honestly have no idea what I'm doing lol

I actually do. I was really homesick when I got here and wasn't sure how I'd like the huge emphasis on tests, but I love the lack of busy work. I've been able to study before the day before for once in my life- and have actually had to, because there's so much information. I'm not as much a fan of the lecture only classes, and much prefer the discussions, but the material is really interesting. I have a good Spanish teacher too, which is especially nice because my high school teachers really didn't teach me anything. Overall, I spend a lot less time in class and a lot less time doing actual work, so as long as I make sure not to become a recluse, it works for me. I spend a lot of time in the common room so I can both be productive and get actual human contact."
ESTJ,"Sorry it took me forever to get to this. Had some real life stuff going on that demanded my attention.

Tsubaki said:
I have another question for my ESTJ-buddies, regarding functions ^^
How do you use Si? How does it work and how does it affect your life?
Si, that I'm personally aware of, works in a few ways for me:

It's used to identify inconsistency and consistency in sums of data, information, and experiences.

It's used as a measuring stick for Te; I overlay Te intake with Si (experiential) intake and look for underlying patterns/breaks in patterns.

It's used as a way to tap into feeling and emotion.

I've read that Si-users are very conscious about their body. Do you think that this is true for you?
I've never read that claim before. Do you have a source?

I am very conscious of my body, but I've never associated it with Si...I associate it more with being a strong sp-dom (I'm jumping theories, I know). I guess I could see the function being body-oriented, since it's basically the sensory version of Ni.

But I think in that case it would be patterns in the physiology, not necessarily standalone things.

As a Si-inferior, I feel like I don't notice/pay attention to the needs of my body. Hunger just goes away again if I don't pay attention to it and when I feel a pain somewhere, I usually can't pin down, what exactly hurts. In most cases, I just take some painkiller and continue with what I was doing. Also, I tend to feel rather foreign in my body, like it's just a tool and the ""real me"" is something else.
I am acutely aware of my physical self; I don't pay attention to it in the day-to-day, but it grabs my attention immediately when something is not right. I know exactly where my pains come from; I know if they are normal or abnormal. I know if they merit additional attention or if they can be ignored.

It can be difficult for me to ignore things like hunger. Even if I try to ignore it, the sensation is powerful and tends to be very distracting.

That said, I am the first person to ignore pains if they're not serious and I have something on my plate that I care more about. I believe niss noted a statistic somewhere that said SJs are the types that often end up being killed off by physically-related issues later in life. We tend to ignore/put off physical problems for the sake of higher priority issues.

Basically, if the pain doesn't impede us from completing a goal, we'll ignore it until we have free time to deal with it.

If it does, we get it checked out/fixed asap.


As to being detached from my body and feeling like the real me is something else, no. Never experienced that.

I've thought about whether or not I could swap bodies with other people and decided I would have a problem with it. Ultimately, it wouldn't be entirely me. My body is a part of me."
ESTJ,Where are you? ESTJs seem to be hard to find.
ESTJ,"Not on here, that's for sure.

As to IRL...I have no idea. At work?"
ESTJ,"
I truly believe every problem has a solution; and whenever 2 people are involved in a problem, it usually requires a joint effort from both to augment change and implement the solution. I??m running out of ideas.


I doubt that you could significantly alter your communication style in time to save that relationship & it's a fool's errand attempting to change the ESTJ to conform to your style.

Apparently the relationship has deteriorated so much that he's declared you two will no longer engage in fights aka discussions, but that makes little sense because that's how couples work through their difficulties.
As an ESTJ, were I to tell a significant other that I'm done arguing to work through our difficulties, it'd be indicative that I'm tired of the drama & subtlely warning that I'm less invested in the relationship.
So that's a red flag that maybe he's giving up working things out with you. I'd suggest that his declaration of no more ""fighting"" is indicative that he's emotionally distancing himself from you, he's begun preparing himself for the end.





ESTJs are rational realists, it's likely that he's recognized the depth of your incompatibility & accepted that your relationship just wasn't meant to be.
IMHO you'd do well to suggest discussing an exit strategy with him & then seek an upgrade to a more compatible type."
ESTJ,"Hmm, interesting question!

Tywin Lannister for a start, I really love him. Other characters from Game of Thrones would be Littlefinger, Margaery and Dany.

Rey and Leia from Star Wars, Nick Fury and Thor from Avengers. That's the first ones I come up with, might add more later."
ESTJ,"

MBTI-type or just type of person? If MBTI-type, I really don't know. My best friend is an ENTJ, but probably TJs and FPs. If just types of people, it's generally girls, intelligent, common interests, independent, talkative, and most important, talks about important stuff, rather than shallow things.


A gift rather than something you earn, I'm there to help my friend, he is there to help me.


Closed minds, unwillingness to develop.


Most of the memories that I value is not a specific situation, but a situation that ranges from a day to a month. The two I recall at first is a camp I was at for 30 days, and when my class went to Ethiopia for ten days. If I have to pick a specific situation it'd be a few times pretty recently when I'm just spending time talking to my closest friend.


Don't know really... Movie, can't pick. GoT for tv-show though, and same for book. Musical artist, no idea.


To a few people, it plays a pretty important role. But that is a chosen few."
ESTJ,"You're going to have to be a lot more specific. Can you provide contextual details?

At this point your situation is too vague to offer any insight."
ESTJ,"I think there are several reasons for this. First of all, many of us are busy, has more important things to do than being here. Two other important reasons I can think of is disinterest or mistypes. As ESTJ might not always be the most desirable type (cause stereotypes), a subconscious bias could easily take place. I don't have any proof or examples of this, but it wouldn't surprise me.

Also, sorry for that extremely official language, I have no idea why that just happened... xD"
ESTJ,"Generally, I try to be objective, so if I am responsible for something bad happening, I will take responsibility for that. If other people are at fault, I will let them know, but being an Enneagram 9 (very uncommon for any Te-dom), try to do so politely since I honestly fear conflict.
On that note, sometimes I amaze myself at how well I can phrase things both honestly and politely.
If I were only better at public speaking."
ESTJ,"My favorite leisure activities would be wrestling, reading, learning about typology/asoiaf-theories/medieval weapons and military strategies, playing board games (strategy based) with friends, talking to friends, that kinda stuff.

To relax, I usually read, or do something physical.

Free time is usually spent doing something of the leisure activities I mentioned, holidays are usually spent with family dry. Still living home, so I can't do much about it. Would rather spend it with friends, but as they usually spend it with family as well.

(If there's something I missed here that you wanna know, just ask again.)

Tertiary Ne, that's a love-hate-relationship. About a year ago, I loved Ne with all my heart, as it can make me more light-hearted and such. But I stopped valuing that for several reasons, so now there are other reasons for why I like it.

Ne makes sure I can look at things from about every angle, and makes me quick with possibilities, what ways different things can go, but can show in making me unsure of which route is the best, making me imagining all the worst possibilities of something, that kind of things. Mostly it's good though, making sure I can see different ways something can develop."
ESTJ,"I like them.

According to socionics, they're our duals, or best fit for a relationship, as they share all our functions, just in a different order.
While I might not agree that they'd be the best type for a relationship with me, they're definitely nice and interesting people.

Also, welcome to the forum. Nice with another ESTJ!"
ESTJ,"Lol never really bothered to try, sorry

I don't tend to bring MBTI up IRL because there's too much explaining to do only to be told it's shit.

I know it is but i like it."
ESTJ,"I have quite some questions for you as I am trying to understand my dad a little better.

Is it common for ESTJ's to become very pessimistic, maybe even paranoid under stress? Can stress prevent you from taking firm decisions? Or do you have this under normal circumstances as well? Is it just being perfectionistic?

I ask this because my dad has a chronic illness and I think this is affecting his behaviour quite a lot. He talks about going forward, being efficient, practical, looking for solutions..., but he has a hard time deciding on the best way to solve practical problems in the house as he is always looking for the better method.

How could I help him see the other perspective and see the relativity of things without that he feels that I'm not taking him serious (as this would make him angry)."
ESTJ,"Sorry I haven't answered this before.

It is typical for ESTJs to become paranoid under stress, yes. Also, yes, people would probably view us as pessimistic, though for us that's just a way of making sure we know what's ahead of us, which would increase under stress. I haven't experienced being unable to make firm decisions though, and would rather expect that to go up during stress. I don't think those things are because of the fact that we're perfectionistic, though we for sure are.

Hmm, I never had a problem with this, so I'm not able to use any personal experience.
Best thing I can think of, is to talk to him, some time when it's not actually relevant, and talk to him about it. Being objective and factual as far as possible."
ESTJ,"About the relationship question thread, I guess I could create one, but there are so few ESTJs active and not that many questions coming in, so I don't know how active it'd be. I will create one if there's interest for it though. And it's true as you say, we aren't great at relationship-stuff.

About the situation, it's hard for a start, but I'll do my best.
1. It depends. If we believe in the traidition-based restrictions or not. But if we do, whether they are based on tradition or not, desire generally falls on the short end. Desire is only temporary, while what we believe in isn't (or at least we hope it isn't).
2. What would be re-valued? Her decision? Her Fi-based values?
3. I can see ""I don't want to want him anymore"" as something that could easily occur in ESTJs, and it seems more likely in this situation.

What do you mean with her trying to protect you?
Also, I don't think
three or four polite platitudes
would mean that much. You can be polite with anyone. I'd probably go more personal than that, if you want anything more personal than that. Go for the Fi, so to say.

Does that make sense?
Just ask for clarification if needed, or if you want me to develop any answer.

I was just scrolling up and read this - how does the paranoid manifest - self-questioning self-values?
This would manifest in seeing the worst possible outcome in everything. Could be anything really.
@Rivulet, feel free to answer whatever you want! It's not like we're lots of ESTJs here that does. Thanks!"
ESTJ,"@kane_1
I understand that you want an answer from an ESTJ, and I'm sure someone will answer, but I just felt the urge to say something as well. If you don't want an INFP-opinion, just skip it. I hope the ESTJ's don't mind either as this is their thread.

Maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea to go via the parents seeing that she values their opinion strongly and want to do things 'the right way'. I can relate to that as my dad who is ESTJ (and Christian) would prefer to see relationships of his children happen with his consent or at least with some kind of involvement from him. Maybe she feels she let her parents down and herself as it went too fast. I'm not saying you should propose, but rather somehow make contact with them in some way that makes her feel more at ease with the situation.

From what I can see with my dad, stress causes him to get very creative in pessimistic thinking: everything will be interpreted in the worst possible way. For example, our family bought lately, even though second hand, a very expensive vehicle. My brother arranged most of the deal and purchase, but was quite surprised when he paid a part in advance and learned that there was still an extra amount VAT to be paid. He concluded that he had misunderstood the dealer, especially when thinking afterwards of what the man had said. My father on the other hand (who had never talked with or seen the man), felt that the seller was trying to deceive us. When later on there seemed to be a problem with the brakes (because it had stood too long still), this idea was enforced and he was angry with my brother for not being more firm enough towards the seller. However, my brother who had made the contact with the dealer knew enough to trust the man and indeed, in the end, the seller paid for all the extra repairs without too much fuss. I'm not saying it's wrong to be cautious, but for my dad the worst possible interpretation was the reality and he was upset towards others for not seeing this. I'm sure not all ESTJ's are this way and I should add that he is also chronicly ill and therefore more prone to stress.

In your case I think she might believe that this thing between you both was not real, that it's not possible that you really care for her and that she was way too vulnerable too soon.

I think, if your really want her, you'll have to show with your actions that you care (including show respect for what she values, for example her family, etc.).

Ok, I'll give it over to the ESTJ's now."
ESTJ,"My dad is an ESTJ and he goes through relationships the same way I go through sensory stimuli when I'm stressed, and he can be extremely sensitive about his values when I challenge them extensively (as in pulling out the corner stone and tearing down every counter argument, in an attempt to see where it'll take us) with logic."
ESTJ,"I'd ask my accountant how he works his dark magic, but if I found out then I'd actually be on the hook when they depose me.

Sorry, guess you'll just have to become an accountant to find out."
ESTJ,"Hmm, not sure how to answer this. I'm surprised that you find him vague though, generally not something ESTJs are.
Don't have much to say, just wanted to answer so you don't think that we forgot it.


My ESTJ older brother always says to me that I should never initiate any contact to any guy, even if I like him, and to only answer when guys talk to me first.
I found it impractical when there are a lot of girls actually pursue guys and succeeded.
Is this thing related to mbti types or is it just an older brother thing? Because my friend's older brothers are totally cool giving advices to my friend on approaching guys.
Enlighten me please
Interesting. I don't think it's either. Probably a person thing. I have a younger sister, and if she'd ask this kind of question, I would answer the opposite. I've never understood why guys always should initiate contact, and I'd appreciate if a girl interested in me made the first move. Just seems like a tradition based in nothing, which became the norm."
ESTJ,"So... I'm an ENFP and I totally approve of what he said (I'd like to finetune his advice, but I'll skip that for now). Perceived success (having a relationship with someone you pursued) is not always the same as actual success (being with someone who's nuts about you, chases you around, can't believe he won you and touches you every opportunity he gets). Many women will say, ""I asked the guy out and it worked out fine,"" but they won't tell you about the things that aren't working in the relationship because they'd be arguing against their point :bwink: However, some rare women can pull off pursuing men and kudos to them! :smile:

You're of course free to do what you want :smile:

TL;DR: you can pursue a guy and have a reasonable relationship. To have a fantastic relationship where he can't believe his luck, it is better to choose from the men who pursue you.

Edit: but obviously, you'd only pick someone if you like them. Not just because they pursued you."
ESTJ,"See that doesn't make total sense to me because my experience with ESTJs is that while they look at me like I am crazy and I think they think I am incompetent and all that years later I find out they were really super into me. And they ask me out and stuff. So, I wonder if they get shy or feel nervous about dating someone they work with or maybe they think I'm crazy but like me anyway. Idk."
ESTJ,"I didn't know where else to put this, but my ESTJ was being silly and proclaimed this among his friends.

""I'll just have to lead by example!""

For some reason, it sounded like something ESTJ would say. roud:"

Yep.

Good day.

I wonder if I can hold up an argument with an ESTJ.."
ESTJ,"I nerded out a bit.

I find it amusing how ESTJ/INFP inverted cognitive functions work themselves out.

Imagine being on different ends of a color spectrum (a rainbow where the colors are vertical instead of horizontal) and the pot of gold is in the middle. We end up eventually meeting where the pot of gold is, but traversed different colors of the rainbow to reach the middle.

It's like we come to the same conclusion on things, but from very opposite ends of the spectrum, so we end up filling in gaps in each other's train of thought.

Kind of like in statistics with the Normal Distribution (68-95-99.7) Rule. Place the ESTJ on the left end of the distribution and INFP on the right end of the distribution.



I'll explain in the INFP's perspective.

Everything from the mean to the right end comes naturally to the INFP. Anything below the mean are the ideas more natural to the ESTJ, so INFP has to work harder to understand because they're ideas that the INFP doesn't come up with naturally and may even feel foreign. If the INFP takes the time to understand the ESTJ's rational, it may widen their perspective. Vice versa for the ESTJ with delving into the natural territory of the INFP.

First standard deviation into ESTJ territory won't be too difficult for the opposite party to understand.
Past 1st standard deviation and within 2nd standard deviation will be a little harder for to understand.
Past 2nd standard deviation and within 3rd standard deviation will be very difficult for to understand.
Greater than 3 standard deviations are potentially impossible to understand or will take incredible insight to understand.

So generally, both types being cognitive inverts with similar ideals can complement each other's train of thought by sharing their half of the bell curve to each other. It's like being able to unlock the weaker ends of our functions through each other's strengths.

And ultimately, unlocking the whole spectrum of the rainbow by helping each other through the Fi-Ne-Si-Te / Te-Si-Ne-Fi stack!"
ESTJ,"I don't get what the Greek letters mean in maths, but uhh okay!"
ESTJ,"Yes, I've been long distance with an ESTJ for 3 years, together 5 years total. Totally doable.

We chatted on Gchat/text all day and would webcam at night.

I was in grad school in LA for 3 years and he moved back to SF for work, but the distance really wasn't a problem since we were both busy pursuing our careers.

He did fly me up every month so that we could see each other, so that helped.

The longest we didn't see each other in person was probably 3 months.

It did all start out by me telling him, ""I got accepted to grad school and we're going to have to be 3 years long distance while I chase after my dream. I will understand if you want to end our relationship because of the distance.""

He decided to stay with me, and now that I've graduated, I'm closing the gap and moving in with him soon."
ESTJ,"Depends on what kind of trip it is. My guess is that I'd have it in the back of my head for weeks before leaving, putting away things that I need, decide what I'll bring, etc. The packing itself wouldn't take long. Just, normal packing.

Choice said:
How much value & effort do you put upon acting ""normal"" ? How much does it vary in different circumstances?
Normally, almost nothing. When at funerals and other instances when you need to act a certain way (not start laughing, joking, etc), I'll think of it. It's not hard to act ""normal"", but I'll have to think of it, and stop impulses.

Are ESTJs uncomfortable with being open and honest in a relationship? would they rather leave their significant other in the dark and let them figure everything out?
In a relationship, no. It's be close. I can be uncomfortable being too open with people I don't know, or shallow relationships. But in a relationship (I guess you're talking about a close one?) openness shouldn't be a problem.

ientipi said:
Is it typical for an ESTJ to consistently forget about plans with someone they are romantically interested in?

Asking because I was involved with an ESTJ 5w6, but after he blew me off every single time we made plans over the span of 6 months, I decided to end things. But I don't know if this was simply him not caring or if it is a typical ESTJ thing which I should have been less harsh to him about.
It's sounds very out of character for a typical ESTJ. Forgetting plans in the first place, and even more when it's about someone you care about. Of course, it'd differ with every person, and I can't speak for this ESTJ in particular.

It sounds especially unlikely if we consider their romance style in socionics."
ESTJ,"For me personally:
Restlessness - This usually happens when I'm stuck in a group setting or having to converse with people that I cannot find common ground with (Ex: differing tastes in music that I have no idea about)-- it doesn't challenge me logically/intellectually so I become really restless. I just kind of let it be-- I allow myself just to be bored if I can't leave the situation or find someone else to converse with. If I'm alone, usually I'll find a friend to go do something with or do something that I enjoy alone.
Anxiety - As rare as it is, I recognize this happens when I feel like I do not have control over my emotions or something triggers a negative emotional response that I don't necessarily want to voice/talk about. But I've recognized this is just a part of life/feelings.
Afraid of - Losing all the important people around me: family mostly. Other than that, I'm not afraid of much. Perhaps heights? But I don't think that's what you mean.

I don't know if this helps, but that's how it is for me personally."
ESTJ,Hell no. I think we're one of the most direct personality types. I find it really difficult to not voice how I feel. I also find it very difficult to omit/hide things.
ESTJ,Definitely not. I would never forget if I was romantically interested. Plans/scheduling is REALLY important to ESTJs.
ESTJ,"I'm not sure he fits the definition of superhero, but I'd probably prefer Iron Man. When it comes to superpower(s), intelligence, knowledge, wisdom.


Do you ever just.. take a break where you don't do anything? It seems to me like ESTJ's just never sit down and be lazy.
Not really doing nothing, but times when I'm doing nothing productive. Reading fiction happens quite a bit. Also, shaving. Could be done a lot quicker and more simple than I do, but I like the time when I'm not doing anything else, just focusing on that one thing.


Hmm interesting... I've never been with an ESTJ before and idk if I can handle that certain behavior... If they are very honest, and they don't show much emotion, would that mean they tend to be harsh? no empathy? that wouldn't go well with ISFP types then I guess :/
It's a matter of health. If the ESTJ is unhealthy, this could be a really big problem. In the case of a healthy ESTJ, it depends. In shallow relationships that we don't care much about, yes, then we're harsh, and don't show much empathy. But not with people we really care about. It'd probably still be more harsh than an ISFP, but it's certainly not as bad. It'd be one of the harder areas, but if met in the middle, it'd result in a lot of growth for both.

Also, I've noticed that strong Fi types bring out the Fi in me, and makes it show more."
ESTJ,"This is legitimately a self-improvement project I've taken on. Trying to just sit and relax. Read a book. Watch a movie. But I almost never succeed. There are always projects to do, friends to hang out with, errands to run.

Superhuman strength. No doubt in my mind."

ESTJ,"

Do you ever just.. take a break where you don't do anything? It seems to me like ESTJ's just never sit down and be lazy.
Yes, I try to. Since I got pregnant, for instance, I decided I will ??take it easy?? (and stuff?) and I've somehow succeeded, for a few days at some point, to lay back and... just relax. And I've never felt so guilty in my entire life. I feel like the world is ripping apart. I'm thinking I don't want to do it ever again. :shocked: (well, at this point, I'm actually unable of doing certain things I desire, but I do 'cheat' sometimes and start overworking myself with things, until I get to a point where I'm exhausted and I need to rest for a few days -and then the guilt settles in even deeper).
@EJCC

I agree that ESTJs are direct. I agree that ESTJs are likely to be direct in relationships. I agree that ESTJs are unlikely to lie a lot in relationships, because they take them so seriously and are so god damned lawful (D&D alignment wise). That being said, not all ESTJs are great at expressing their feelings. ESTJs take forever to process their feelings, and only when they're done processing can they even attempt to articulate them. In the meantime, they may be very withdrawn and uncommunicative. That's our INFP shadow at play.
I sometimes feel very withdrawn and uncommunicative. I don't think I have serious problems with showing my emotions -but people do often misunderstand me, and that's probably because even though I think I communicate things perfectly well, I actually don't. And if I think of certain instances... yeah, I do have problems communicating my feelings. Sometimes I just refuse any type of socializing and anything that concerns 'communication' and I just wish to not bother with expressing anything at all."

I'd say they just don't take to MBTI. My sister is ESTJ and she said ""Oh that's interesting"", but that's about

ESTJ,"There are extrovert and introvert, sensual and intuitive, thinking and feeling, judging and perceiving. Those are the key traits of Keirsey's personality type model.

ESTJ,"When an ESTJ is upset they generally try to compensate such by regaining or controlling their surroundings, often ignoring or repressing the internal issue itself.
Though this is rather a type 8 response.

Type 3 ESTJs will most likely do the same but to control/regain their image or success."
ESTJ,"
I follow no traditions. That tradition-following image probably comes from the lack of being too spontaneous (and I mean 'too', because we are spontaneous sometimes). I don't conform much, not even on Christmas, Easter and other traditional holidays. Family traditions? WTF is that? Seriously, if it's something like going fishing every other Sunday of the month, I'd rather hate to do it - I don't like to HAVE-TO-DO anything. So... no ESTJs are the same, I guess.


Depends on what you mean when you say private. I'm private in terms of my important plans, and emotions which may change a result/goal I'm going after. I'm manipulative, so I'm private about what my true intentions are. For the sake of 'whatever-it-is' I can be really open, but it will be fake, and all I tell you will serve me some purpose. Of course, I can be honestly open (rarely, cause I don't really need to, I deal with my shit alone) but I'll never tell you something which you can effectively use against me... ever. (most people are not like that, so that could be not coming from the ESTJ personality, that could be just me specifically)
The only way you can make me be open, truthful, etc. with you is if you are more intelligent than I am and you've proven that you care about me a lot (by giving me more intelligent solutions to my problems) - that is if you want to make an ESTJ open up. Again - that could be just me.


I can't stand stupid. Unintelligent. Too emotional. Especially, too emotional + stupid = get TF away from me. I also can't stand people who let other people walk all over them, people who don't stand up for themselves, weak, feeble, whatever... people who only follow and never lead. All else is negotiable but being an idiot in that way towards yourself and your life is what puts me off the most in other people.


I am but I don't really care about large groups and one-on-one is often more fun because it's more meaningful. Also, you can manipulate better one-on-one. Large groups are fun. One-on-one has some point. And I, personally, prefer it to have some point. Most extroverts probably like large groups because they haven't got a hidden agenda like I do. Introverts prefer one-on-one because they don't like large groups and whatever. My reasoning - I'll use either the one-on-one or the large group to my benefit. I like large groups, though, for fun.


I usually prefer extroverted people but if intelligent enough, an introvert will catch my attention. However, I can't stand people with no social skills, or people who avoid others. I don't like it when you don't communicate at all with the shop assistants or waiters, or if you can't talk to strangers (for whatever reason) because of being shy or avoiding people in general. I value social skills and I like anyone who's got better ones than mine.

Why do you think ESTJ and ISTJ are that different? The only difference is the extrovert-introvert part, right? Big deal. It's much worse if some of the other letters are different, imo"
ESTJ,"I worked under an ENTJ in my last gig. ENTJ type 3.

Primary difference is he is heavily long term strategical as compared to me. When working I am thinking about short term future-- next couple of years. He's thinking more long term-- next seven to ten years.

He excelled at seeing the overarching strategies. He falteref at designing effective tactical steps to achieve these goals due to analysis paralysis. He started gathering information and suddenly there was never enough info to push him to make a decision. He was also terrible at focusing on the right details. Under stress he would pull out a microscope and try to control everything that didn't actually matter to achieving the goal.

He also had a habit of putting too much responsibility on his employees. This was good and bad: it helped every person in the office take full ownership of their work and be proactive about solving issues themselves when they arose. However, it meant when real problems that required his intervention as an authority occurred he was too quick to tell an employee to take responsibility and deal with it themselves (rather than step up and get involved).

That said, he was one of the brightest men I've had the pleasure to work with. A very intelligent, capable man, with a lot of wisdom. We would spend hours talking after work sometimes and I'd come away feeling like I'd taken a masters class in business ownership and leadership. He has been a major positive influence on my professional life."
ESTJ,"I don't think I've become more prejudiced or tolerant. I'm not more or less open to people as a result of MBTI.

I am, however, better at finding ways to communicate with people I engage with. I can switch up my communication style to better suit them. That has been immensely useful for me."
ESTJ,"Okay, I have an ESTJ friend (female) who goes around saying everything she hears. You can't tell her a secret expecting her to actually keep it secretive. Is this a common trait within ESTJ's, and more importantly; are they even trustworthy?

Secondly, this ESTJ can also be angered quite easily. One time, a very sweet girl told her something that, even as an ENFJ, I saw no disrespect behind, and the ESTJ responded by giving the girl a slight shove.

She's generally really nice to her friends, but not very nice to people she doesn't know well.

This is a very naive comment as I have only ever met one ESTJ and it is her, and I haven't done any research on this MBTI personality. I understand that one person does not represent a whole entire MBTI personality, and I truly hope I haven't offended anyone by my questions and comments."
ESTJ,"The ESTJ you're describing sounds very immature, especially if she can't control her emotions. However, I can repeat a lot of things that I hear as I make everyday conversations but if it was a sensitive topic that was shared to me or someone specifically asked it to be kept a secret, I would not share that information. ESTJs can be very trustworthy."
ESTJ,"So, most other forums has one like this, but I couldn't find one here.

(think we'll need one regarding all the stereotypes here...)
So guys (and girls), just go on and shoot any questions you'd like!
(other ESTJs are welcome to answer as well of course, but I guess you don't need an invitation for that..)"
ESTJ,"I think ENFPs are great for friendship. One of my best friends is an ENFP, and I love to listen to you guys speak about the things you are passionate about! But I dated an ENFP once and it was a disaster. Not good for romantic relationships."
ESTJ,"It's really Ni-Se vs Ne-Si and Gamma vs Delta.

In my experience ENTJ is more one track minded and is like a bulldozer in terms of themselves and their goals, and a bit more actually domineering than ESTJ. (Although ESTJ can seem that way they are slightly more flexible to having others make decisions having Ne. Similarly to how an ESFJ is. It's really one of the big differences in Ne vs Ni.) I think it's easier to see the Fi of ESTJ since they have Si.. Making them a bit sentimental. ENTJs would probably perceive ESTJs as a bit softer than they are. (Not that they're soft, but I mean compared to ENTJ everyone is lol!)

I think ESTJ humor tends to be a bit lighter, maybe a bit childish and pun filled (like the rest of the Deltas) and ENTJ tends to be more cutting and edgy.

I would say Leon Lush on YouTube is closer to ENTJ and Lawrence Sonntag from FunHaus on YouTube is an ESTJ.

I wouldn't say long term vs short term is the best indicator, both tend to be very successful."
ESTJ,"I'm going through something very similar with my ESTJ husband. Switching jobs, kind of a new field, worried he won't have what it takes etc.

Engage his Si. Remind him of his strengths where this job is concerned and the times in the past when he has used those strengths to his ability.

With my husband I reminded him of how nervous he was when he switched jobs after his last employer closed down. His job was different and he was worried that he wouldn't learn the new skills adequately. I told him that he's top in his field for a reason and his ability to learn things on his feet is amazing.I gave him examples and I told him that not only did he learn the skills he needed, but he did so at a rate that got him promoted very quickly. I told him that I had 100 percent confidence in his ability to learn what he needs because I've seen him do it countless times in the past.

If he's good in sales, tell him so and give specific examples."
ESTJ,"the only people i hang out with are NFs. my entire close circle of friends are NFs. i cry at least once a week. i believe feelings are 100% valid. i support people relentlessly in their emotional needs + i'm super duper empathetic and considerate of people's feelings + needs. i try to see outside of my own perspective all the time. i test sometimes as an NF type because i have such a strong fi + have learned how NFs process and see the benefits of that as well. i can't process fully like that, it makes me uncomfortable to function in more long-term greys vs. short-term black + whites, but i understand that sometimes it's better the other way depending on the situation. i have my NF friends to thank for all of this.

i love deep conversations, i'm an artist, and i don't care much about conventional rules. lol. sometimes i don't think i'm an estj anymore, but i know my functional stack is definitely that of an estj, i think i've just learned how to better make use of my other less developed functions.

i really believe if people are cultivating personal growth + self-awareness, your type only matters so much."
ESTJ,"1. No opinion. You may have an easier time typing your boss if you figure out what about the show he likes/what stands out to him. TV show taste isn't the most accurate indicator of type unless there's a very clear ""it appeals to this function"" going on.

2. Absolutely not in a corporate setting, especially if no one else dresses that way. If I were to do casual, I would make sure it was still fashionable/put together."
ESTJ,"Work for? Or set up?

Either way, it would probably be in advertising or media production."
ESTJ,"We are tough-guys, even if we feel fear, we don't like to admit it.

That said, I hate dealing with psychopaths. And by that I mean, extreme arbitrary, erratic, violent, impulsive people, who lack any sort of self control or reason.

Next in line would be narcissists, but they are more annoying than terrifying.

Actually, narcissistic psychopaths are probably the worst as in, they don't target you but your family members, to make you pay for the tiniest offence and they come (sometimes) with a fan-club to boot."
ESTJ,"I've observed my husband doing both depending on the situation.
Modeling the type of man he wants our sons to be through his actions and character.
Directly influencing them through words and directions.
Setting expectations and guidelines, and giving them advice on how to make decisions etc."
ESTJ,"dating wise? or friendship wise?

i can only speak on friendship level. i have 2 intjs friends. i just accept them as they are. their ti and my te clash, but i just let that be. i think in a romantic relationship it would drive me crazy to always be clashing on a logical consistency basis.

one of the intjs is basically in love with me, & i can't even explain to him why i won't ever be with him-- it just doesn't ""make sense"" to him why i wouldn't. & it's bc he doesn't understand i'm constantly working around his logical consistencies (like taking a certain route even tho it's further or parking somewhere specific that he's parked before) and he's not even aware of it. as a friend, once in a while dealing with it is fine, but i can't imagine being in a relationship + having to deal with that all the time. it'd drive me batshit crazy for sure.

the other one is super easy going. and i'd totally marry him if things don't pan out with anyone else, but the marriage would be very practical. it seems to always be missing the emotional depth that i'm looking for. (i'm a weird estj okay?!).

don't know if this helps, but that's my 2 cents."
ESTJ,"Since it's our dominant function, yes, we use it all the time and most naturally.

I'm not sure what Te looks like on a daily basis. Probably looking for information, synthesizing it, and making decisions based on it. Eg, bank line has seven people in it, I need to be somewhere else in 20 minutes. I'll swap out this task with another and then come back to the bank later.

So yeah, efficiency oriented. I think as an ESTJ, the focus is on using time well and effectively."
ESTJ,"There's more non-ESTJ posts here than the opposite.
They're probably doing actual work."
ESTJ,"I have no issue with Ne, personally. I use it enough that I've strongly considered retyping as an Ne-dom at various points in life.

As I understand it Ne is in the creative role for ESTJ, meaning we like it and like to use it in creative ways. However, we are not as adept at using it as an Ne-dom."
ESTJ,"
I have an ESTJ manager who often forgets the things she says she will do/forgets the things you have said to her (in regards to work related issues). It always completely confuses me because for someone who is so task and detailed oriented who generally remembers such weirdly specific details she'll completely forget something you've told her multiple times in the span of ten minutes. For me, even if I haven't rememberd a specific event I can picture myself understanding how that event would have come to be if someone mentions to me that I have forgot something (Ne) and I can move forward with intuition fixing whatever problem has come; my ESTJ manager will just compeletly forget and not just forget but vehemently deny such a thing ever being said/happening. I honestly don't know how to navigate this behavior she has. I've noticed this behavior in a few ESTJs and it perplexes me. I would assume for someone so logically consistent and detail oriented that these things wouldnt fly over an ESTJs head as much as it does?



Ne in ESTJs particularly of the slightly more relaxed version is super obvious. Especially in a more casual enviorment; you can see it in ESTJ ""story-time"" where an ESTJ will start going on random Si/Ne tangents; ESTJs can often have a really great sense of humor and be quite funny and enjoy creativity (you don't see it as much in ESTJ work mode). I have known some ESTJs to venture into art and creative projects. I think (bad) Ne grips in ESTJs make ESTJs seem *super* paranoid. Never fun to be in the presence of an ESTJ in a non-functioning Te-Ne loop - although it's kind of hilarious. My ESTJ manager will become just completely and utterly scatterbrained, paranoid by every possibility, messy (A lot of ESTJs are really messy and have like a sort of organized chaos I don't think cleanliness is actually a strength of a lot of ESTJs.) it's like she looses all sight of organizational skills. She will have papers and stuff everywhere, a mess that she made then complain that she can't work in an enviorment like that (but she doesn't even think to clean it up lol).

Every ESTJ I've known has hated my Ne (initially); but also loved it. I remember when I started working with my ESTJ manager she would tell people ""man this girl asks a lot of questions"". She would complain about it initially and I knew she didn't love the amount of questions I asked but at the end of day because of all my questions I would do everything right and cover all my bases (exactly why I do this). I look at every possibility and every situation from different angles so if a situatuon did come up I can react when that situation did come up. Eventually she was using me as example to other staff because I wasn't afraid to ask questions. And because of my questions I was doing everything right. ESTJs only find Ne annoying if there's no follow-through as long as you can prove your competence and it takes a long time for ESTJs to trust anyone so it's not overnight. Always expect some amount grumbles from an ESTJ though when you're talking to them with a lot of Ne (especially in a work enviorment). I've known many ESTJs to apologize for acting too harshly in the moment but don't expect it until later and probrably after you've proven yourself to them.

If she's vehemently denying it, it sounds more like an ego issue than anything else.

I often forget things I've said. But I'm also really, really consistent, so I can easily perceive what I would/wouldn't say in a situation. This helps me confirm whether or not someone's claim about what I said in the past is true or not."
ESTJ,"



what do you mean he treated you differently? talked to you less? If I have someone I usually talk to them more. I think and maybe it's just me but I fall in to following someone if I love them or can support their cause and then later realize, oh well x is sort of controlling aren't they? I dated a ISFP who was super paranoid and I lost a lot of friends. Maybe he texted you because he saw your name or changed his mind? don't know what it is, but maybe it's that. I did that a lot of last year end of last year. then when you blocked him he may have felt betrayed or some such thing? If someone blocks me I am a bit skeptical I think of a lot of drastic what if sort of catastrophe thinking. I think some of us are more open to apology and express skepticism differently. I usually use that time to define hey look this is what friendship means. I forgive you, fine, but learn the perimeters. I attribute a lot of things to disrespect and rudeness and I tolerate none of that! I usually don't give them all my trust back right away I try to test the waters first and see if they can be someone that respects me and if they have really changed and learnt from their mistakes. The best thing you can do is prove yourself right. I'd probably ask first why are you acting like this. the ESTJ will tell you either that they are not trying to or be able to give you some sort of reason why they are acting differently. I think if it was me, I would have said something like. You mind talking it out with me instead of just blocking me? It feels a bit like betrayal to me that you did that."
ESTJ,We're pretty busy I think you know that. If I M focused I don't have time to post on here too much.
ESTJ,"1. I'm not well read enough on the benefits and drawbacks of various forms of government. I would say what I favor highly depends on what I want to see accomplished. Each government type has its own advantages.

On a personal level, I like representative democracies. Perhaps a liberal democracy.

2. Parents are not ESTJ.

3. It highly depends on context. I am occasionally asked by my current director to do things that are an absolute waste of time. I will explain why I think a task/project is ineffecient, but if I'm told to do it after I've had my say, I do it. In this circumstance, the prevailing ""logic"" is that I'm here to do my work and get paid for my time and services.

I don't think there's some automatic respect for authority that comes into the decision making process. It's just about boundaries.

If it's something in my personal life, I make the best decisions I can for myself. How I feel about something is the final authority."
ESTJ,"Congregate? Like, a place where ESTJs are likely to gather in order to do ESTJ things?

I have no earthly idea. I'm personally all over the place, but only where I need/want to be. Maybe you can infer that some types are more likely to have some interests and thus gather in places where they would be relevant, but I can't really think of anything like that for ESTJs in general.

This sub was my best guess and even then, it seems not a lot of ESTJs are particularly keen on discussing MBTI too often."
ESTJ,"
Finally....

there aren??t many...any... estjs... you have to stay... stay... STAY...

So, I just have to go everywhere?
Haha, good thing I ran out of things to do and decided to check the forum again on a whim. Else I'd have probably gone like three days without seeing this. I'll try to visit more often.

Essentially, yes. I suppose you could try going around talking to everybody and hoping you meet an ESTJ through serendipity. Good rule of thumb: Try to waste their time with seemingly pointless chatter. Anyone who outright asks you ""what do you want"" has high odds of being ESTJ. Of course, there are several other types that shy away from small talk and being overly social, but I at least personally would feel inclined to at least get closure out of a pointless conversation. ""Were they trying to scam me? Did they need something from me and I didn't get it? Maybe they're just chatty?"" Are things I find myself pondering after an awkward interaction. Then again, my impulsive need to help people whenever I can afford it may be something personal rather than a type thing.

On second thought, you'd probably look creepy if you actually did go around talking to everybody just to see their response... Anyways, I hope I was able to contribute at least a little insight."
ESTJ,"I'll try to help the best I can, then. Answering a few questions seems easy enough."
ESTJ,"So, most other forums has one like this, but I couldn't find one here.

(think we'll need one regarding all the stereotypes here...)
So guys (and girls), just go on and shoot any questions you'd like!
(other ESTJs are welcome to answer as well of course, but I guess you don't need an invitation for that..)"
ESTJ,"I tried it on a whim once. I figured that I would practice and get better at it, but then I got too busy to continue and dropped it. In hindsight, there wasn't much I actually wanted to draw, but I figured that I'd do it just for the sake of knowing how to do it if I ever needed it. I also kinda wanted to show off to a friend that liked to draw so we could have another topic in common...

Drawing is also going to be a skill I'll be developing at university since I'm going for an engineering degree, but that's a different kind of drawing than the ones you do for fun, I think."
ESTJ,"Yes. I had tried a lot of things out just for the sake of getting this one's attention. It didn't really pan out though, since every time the thought of showing anything to her, I'd just go back to working on it because I didn't think it was good enough. Before I knew it, it was no longer about impressing her, but rather, finally being satisfied with myself and achieving that peace of mind.

In the end, I didn't get the girl, but I did acquire a genuine interest in a lot of hobbies, some of which I still practice to this day. I was a more wholesome person at the end of it all. I'm glad I had that crush on her because it motivated me to better myself and seek out new things."
ESTJ,"In actuality, part of me is still scarring from some stuff that happened after the fact. I've went through a lot of trouble to deliberately bury the feelings I had and any memory that could make them surface. Used to be that I would just see something that reminded of a random fact about her, and then I'd remember everything that I knew, and then I'd remember her smile, and then I'd get sad.

At the time, ignoring everything that happened was the only way I knew to stop the pain. Maybe I'm still subconsciously avoiding it, even though it doesn't hurt me anymore."
ESTJ,"Smiling is the only way I can assure casual friends/acquaintances that I do not hate them and am looking at them with sheer disgust, as my default expression might indicate.

I feel that maybe smirking helps me be more confident in myself. And if I'm actually grinning, then I'm really happy. Probably because something went very well and I'm basking myself in a mad banquet of satisfaction."
ESTJ,"I would look at them a lot, probably? And smile? Honestly, not much different from how everyone looks, I guess.

I don't know, I never managed to catch a glimpse of my own face when glancing longingly at someone else."
ESTJ,"I knew my husband was interested in me because I would catch him looking at me a lot. When I'd catch his eye, he'd lok really intense with this half smile half smirk.

I asked him why it took him forever to approach me and he said he was assessing the situation. Seeing if I was interested, unattached, etc."
ESTJ,"Well, you're Te-doms like us, so obviously you have a good head on your shoulders.

Other than that, I don't have many thoughts about it since I never did meet many of you. I think one of my classmates back in high school could have been ENTJ, and I admired her for a lot of the characteristics you'd attribute to ENTJs.

I also, despite repeatedly reading several explanations about it, don't really grasp what Ni actually is about. So I don't have a clear idea of how we're different from each other."
ESTJ,I take the silence as a definite ??yes??~
ESTJ,"Depends on stalking, but there are options:
1) If opponent is strong, attempts to hide. If opponent is weak, punch in the face, maybe no violence, but you get the vibe.
2) Blushing."
ESTJ,False belief mostly. Never had any exceptional problems with that specific type.
ESTJ,"If you wanna know something about ESTJ's emotions in general, then it's likely a thing they are most vulnerable at, completely their weakest part. In healthy manner emotional needs shouldn't be ignored by ESTJ, but rather be very personal and very unknown even to ESTJ himself. At least this is what I think. Using emotions makes me feel 'weak', it's just not my thing, but I appreciate them a lot. I surely feel them, but often don't really comprehend them completely, fail to express them, overall it's something to hide and to keep for yourself, because I wouldn't want to make a wrong step. Meanwhile dominant thinking function is complete opposite, it can be powerful, brash, outbursting and spitting logic, where it needs to. So if you think, you can read very subtle things and silent agreements, then relationship can start. I can say that after my grandpa's death, almost 5 months ago, I still haven't touched emotional conversations topic. Not because I don't feel anything, but because becoming vulnerable freaks me out. Similar to being naked in public. And the thing is that I probably felt the biggest emotional impact out of all of those people, but I never told that to anyone.
Click to expand...
I guess you are talking about this, but i would like to know what ESTJs think of other people's sensitivities. This seems to me that you are talking about your own emotions. The reason i am asking is, my mom is an ESTJ and whenever i try to explain a problem of mine she just can not comprehend why i don't do things in a logical manner. I can't seem to explain her that my emotions are in my way, she tries to understand me i can see that, but it also seems like something so unfamiliar to her. So i'm actually wondering how you guys perceive it, like what is really going on inside your head when you encounter smb like that."
ESTJ,"I believe I can help. With less self-aware ESTJ's, inferior Fi suppresses their own feeling based judgments and so they tend to consider that the same in others is also a weakness. It's a projection. They have spent their lives suppressing their feeling based judgements and that has given them success so it becomes a self-repeating cycle of suppression > validation - which then again gets projected to others because they had success with it. Emotions while not Jungian related in terms of psychology similarly also got repressed because repression for them reaps rewards over time ... Then comes the nature of Si where it's mostly projection of what worked for them would work for others - and since repression of emotion worked for them, it'll work for someone else too. Most (if not all) ESTJ's don't have the time or the energy or even desire to understand emotions of others at all because they're so busy repressing all of that F related ""stuff"" in their own mind. They need to be repressed because if they're not repressed then they get in the way of achieving what they wanted to achieve. My dad is a lot like your mom in that regard. Only after turning 73 has he started somewhat exploring his emotional side, but even then he'll share a few emotional things one day and then go back to his repressive state the next like nothing ever happened. Right now one of my cousins is dying of a stroke (he's only 51) and my dad has no emotion to speak of. None at all. It's clear that he's buried it so deep that it seems like it doesn't even exist - and he probably believes that it doesn't exist for him either.

The solution? Go and do it anyway. Succeed and then tell them. See, there are other ways of doing things that work as well."
ESTJ,Ok...thanks.
ESTJ,???
ESTJ,"Not at all. I really appreciate nice people.

I do, however, get bored with people who are nice to the point of being doormats. Or people who lack a certain level of decisiveness."
ESTJ,"I know a lot of people say ESTJ are not very affectionate and kind but I disagree with my experience with a few I know. Which bring me to my question, are ESTJ affectionate and kind to people ingeneral? If not do they just have to be close to the person? And do ESTJ dislike nice people?"
ESTJ,"Ok, I'm not ESTJ, but I know a number of them.

Usually people say ESTJs are mean and not affectionate , then someone comes in with an exception like ""ESTJs aren't mean and not affectionate contrary to popular belief.""
It goes back and forth. ESTJs prefer to be more professional in their approach with strangers, not mean, not too nice, just neutral. With people they are close too they can relax and show affection but it is not in ways that are obvious to people who do not know them, some forms of ESTJ affection can be making you the butt of their jokes (this is a way to draw attention to you and pick you out of a group of people to say ""Hey, I notice you, and I like you as a person, otherwise I wouldn't be taking the time to say your name let alone make a joke about you."") Super duper forms of affection are not normal for an ESTJ, they can put on a professional smile, they can be polite to strangers just fine but this does not mean much and only is done because it's how one must conduct themselves in public, or to show they were raised right. This whole professional demeanor is dropped with close friends, as they joke more say more crude things and relax.

ESTJs also do not dislike nice people and they appreciate truly kind people, what they find uncomfortable and distrusting is huge displays of flagrant emotion, they may not know why someone is being so favorable towards them or how honest someone is being when they dole out things like ""OH MY GOD I LOVE YOUUUUU! OH MY GOD I'VE MISSED YOUUUU."" And it's not common for an ESTJ to show those forms of affection. ESTJ forms of affection come more in the form of acts of service. If an ESTJ ever shows concern in your well being or your problems, they care about you to some extent to supply their greatest strength and asset to you, their energy and their time, because ESTJs can be highly scheduled people and do not give their precious time to things that do not matter to them, because they have something more important to do.

If you are seeking warm compassion, ESTJ will respond with professional and neutral responses. So you will be disappointed.

But as far as people close to them, usually these people can range from work buddies who share their work struggles and listen to their work complaints, a stress reliever and sounding board if you will, old time friends they can reminisce with and share those that their worldview, people they can go out with and have a good time drinking a beer with, to people who can help them relax and laugh because they can playfully bring up things that are unordinary and help the ESTJ get out of a serious mind frame and be silly for a few minutes before they get back to work.

With the ESTJs I've known I usually end up being the silly non threatening friend they at first kinda like to keep around, but then start to REALLY like to keep around lol. I've even made my ESTJ boss, who is a pretty intimidating woman, laugh by saying a silly and unusual joke. It seems like a nice treat if the silliness does not distract one from getting work done.

All the ESTJs I've known they've never been super affectionate, even one girl I knew and friends with was not super affectionate, it's more like they are enthusiastic about helping me if I have a goal or a problem, and that's an easy way to see ""Wow this person is a real friend!"" and it's easy to see they care about you through that enthusiasm. I remember one time I missed my bus and it was driving to a bus stop a mile down the street, my ESTJ friend who dropped me off at my current bus stop, saw that I missed my bus, and he pulled up to me and said ""Hey, let's catch that bus."" Like some old time movie crime partner lol, I hopped in the car and he raced after that bus, and he didn't feel burdened or anything, he was excited to help even though it had nothing to do with him, that felt like real friendship, no affection or any of that stuff needed (also we are both guys so that's weird lol). I've also had another ESTJ friend who I let stay at my apartment for 2 months, he fixed me lunch for work everyday he stayed there LOL, without asking, and he cooked for me and my roommate, without asking, we are both guys so it was weird at first but he was happy to do it, and felt like he couldn't stay in my house without contributing something, even though nothing was required, good friend, no extra emotion or affection needed once again, and we are close. I've had another ESTJ friend pay for his own and my plane flight ticket, just because he was excited I agreed to go out of town to an event with him. That to me seems like and ESTJ being ""affectionate."" But I think with strangers they'd rather be professional, polite, neutral, or just social, but not super emotionally expressive or accommodating to people they do not know.

I mean I've seen an ESTJ talk about how when his daughter started to distance herself from him when she was in her rebellious teens, he just started to bring her in closer, taking her everywhere with him and trying to keep the relationship strong.
I've also seen an ESTJ cry many times in public about his wife who passed away years ago, and the way he talks about her you can tell he loved her and she was everything to him.

So yea, they are people, like everybody else.

I know these are really personalized examples, so at best they just provide a bunch of exceptions to common stereotypes, but at least it shows there is no one way to be ESTJ even if thre are common trends among them."
ESTJ,Hahaha. This is like trying to meet warm bodies in a graveyard. But good luck to you.
ESTJ,"Personally, this isn't something I do. Generally speaking, this isn't something ESTJs do. The type is known for being straightforward to a fault.

However, this is something enneagram type sixes have a tendency to do."
ESTJ,"I don't know what the deal is with some extroverts thinking they are introverts. I see this misunderstanding occur more than introverts thinking they might be extroverts. Maybe it's a lack of self awareness for some, I'm not sure. But some ESTJs can be very quite and not social, simply because they aren't interested in what the group is talking about, but once you talk to them about themselves or something they know, you can tell this person could have a conversation with a wall, meaning that once they get started they do not require you to speak anymore lol,<< Extrovert. My Pastor is an ESTJ and he think's he's an introvert because sometimes he likes to get alone and take a break from socializing and read a book -_-.

What I honestly think is this, someone will read the extrovert and introvert descriptions, and an extrovert might read the E descriptions through the lens of ""this is normal behavior everybody does this."" and when they read the I description they see it through the lens of ""Oh wow I do that sometimes, that's what that is? Wow I must be an introvert since I do like alone time sometimes."" Not realizing that their own surprise at why they might like alone time occasionally is the very thing that exposes them as an extrovert, if alone time is something surprising or ""different"" or unusual for you, but not really necessary, you are an E.


TLDR:
Sorry, that probably was a load you did not even care to read lol. I agree, I do think some EXTJs can come off like and think they are extroverts, since they can be socially detached because they simply are not interested in the conversation at had."
ESTJ,"I don't ever think that unless a person gives me proof otherwise. I can't speak for other ESTJs, but I think we generally don't look down on people."
ESTJ,"Hello ESTJs.

Need your advice.

Summary: ENFP mum wants to help her sincere ESTJ teen child achieve her highest potential. Seeks your advice on how to go about doing so.

Background: ENFP mum, INTP dad and ESTJ child. Academically forward family. Child with great big dreams of getting 'recognition in the world, some day'. Very balanced, mature child, however.

Warning: Long context below.

CONTEXT:
My child - going into her teens - I suspect, is an ESTJ. She is very responsible (has always been), mature with what she says and doesn't say, has great discernment around what to share with people (how much and with whom and when), knows to be diplomatic when necessary (to get the job done) and loves the people in her life (though she isn't quick to share much at all about her personal space). She values the family structure, has a fairly linear sort of cause-->effect connections in her thinking, can handle complex operational tasks systematically, has the greatest respect for time and for institutions, respects other people who are worthy of it.

Many wonderful ESTJ qualities.

BUT, she is not a fighter-to-the-top sort of competitive girl. She sets herself high standards, and works systematically towards meeting them, but doesn't have that drive to cross the i's, dot the t's and do the last 10% polishing to go from a 90% level of preparation to a rock solid 100% level. To her, time is so important that if it is spent too much on polishing, it feels like a waste. Plus, the monotony of books-based work bores her, I think. (She never complains, so I don't know for sure. But it seems like that to me.)
Unless, of course, ""the teacher said that polishing was an important step"" prior to going for a test or doing a project. Then, she gives her 105%, if there is such a thing! Her teachers love her to bits!

But where the ask/demand doesn't come from outside, her achievements are always 5% to 10% short of her potential. This burns me as a parent, because I know that she wishes to be right up there at the top and was working towards it the whole time. After multiple instances of settling at a 90-95th percentile range, she now believes that this is all she is capable of being. WHICH IS JUST NOT TRUE! I know I am not overestimating her, because when I have sat with her to ensure the polishing is done, the results are truly reflective of her real potential. But she argues in her mind that her best results only happen when mum helps. Which, of course, isn't helpful at her age. I no longer think it is good for me to actively help her with her studying (she is a teen!), so I don't really help her much unless I feel that she is in danger of destroying her own self-confidence. In topics that are her weak areas, I help her early by reminding her that she needs to put timetables in place and working with her to ensure that she doesn't let the 'boring subjects' slip. Once put on track, she does the work. If I feel she isn't comprehending something correctly, I step in and help. I am happy to help with the learning. But I don't want to help with the goal-chasing itself - those standards are for her to set and work towards.

I am an ENFP. My husband is an INTP. Between us parents, I use my Te a lot lot better than he does, to provide structure and organization and a sense of reliability to her. But you can imagine. How good can an ENFP's structure be? Only mediocre... so I always feel that I am not giving her the right environment to bloom. I am very conscious of how important it is for her that we are reliable and am constantly fighting my own instincts, and doing things more systematically. Honestly, it is only working about 30% of the time when it comes to the 'small things'. But I NEVER LET HER DOWN in anything important.

To support her ESTJ nature:
I give her responsibilities bigger than what most parents give their children and trust her with far bigger things than other parents do. This makes her feel good and she has told me as much. She totally keeps up her end in these matters.

But when it comes to books-based education, I would like her to somehow put the finishing touches without balking.

In general, she does things fast and reliably. If an authority figure wanted her to do it perfectly and explicitly said so, she will work on the perfection bits too. Otherwise, her default behaviour is to do efficient work within a given amount of time and not work towards perfection itself. Is this typical of ESTJ children? My adult-ESTJ friends are such perfectionists!!! How does that happen?

As ESTJs, what suggestion would you have for this mother? I so want to help this sincere, wonderful child be the best that she can be! I so want her to find areas that she will be a natural at, so that she can excel in them effortlessly! Recognition is important to her, I know. But she sometimes has a 90% attitude towards excellence... so her results show exactly that. How can I help her believe in herself more powerfully and find the intrinsic motivation to manifest her best self? Right now, she is settling for too little...


(Please don't judge me as a ""Tiger Mom"". I am only seeking to help my child be her best. I am not interested in her achievements for my own sake... neither do I love her any more or any less because of her results in academic efforts. I respect her individuality. I want to do the right steps to help her be her best self. Please help me.)"
ESTJ,"Dont assume, dont project.

Granted I didnt read most of what you wrote, but either way just let your teen figure it out. Just go with anything she says, support her with any experience she might want to try"
ESTJ,@Coburn is the current resident ESTJ.
ESTJ,"
You're in luck. I'm in academia and one of my male colleagues is ESTJ and has a PhD in philosophy.
Having said that, he's got a razor-sharp mind, but is clearly a sensor. Regardless of who he's speaking to (and he does adjust according to his intended audience), but it's always ""This is A, and then we do B, and so C happens"", etc. Very linear (which as a fellow SJ, I appreciate a great deal)."
ESTJ,"Our first fight. People are always nice when you first meet them, and love interests are always perfect when you first date them. I have a 6 month rule, no exclusivity before that. Let us run into trouble, misunderstandings, fights.

Only then you will know the true face of people, and if they're mature enough to stick it out with you and communicate effectively. Not many can do this though, be aware that your success rate may not be as high. But who cares? Why would you settle for less in a relationship."
ESTJ,"Cross posted in the ISTJ forum, I think said person is xSTJ - so insight would be appreciated.

Alright I am going to post here despite the fact that this area seems as dead as the ENTJs area haha.

So here goes. There has been a girl in my life for years, decades.
She was literally the first person in my adult life that I considered making my gf, I never told her that.
I was young, I felt like it was corny - I never took her for a girl that liked corny shit. She always made me feel - young.

She had her stuff together, always seemed like a step a head of me. Graduated from school before me - bachelors. Graduated from Law school before I became a Chiro. Got a BMW when I was driving a old truck. Got a house when I was still living in an apartment.

Going back in time - when we were young. She was just about to go to Law school and that's the first time we admitted to liking one another despite having mutual friends. We were still going to clubs, we danced, we flirted before but she seemed bigger than me and I couldn't get a read on her. Weeks before she left, we messed around. I wasn't sure if it was just the alcohol in us, but to make a long story short it didn't go well because her mom busted us making out at her apartment as she kicked everyone partying out one morning.

So I was like crap - we ended our time before she left, with her saying we could go out and get a beer. It was Modelo Especial, I remember how radiant she was that night and it was intimidating. Anyway, her being the one ahead of me dropped me off. She literally told me before we left - so are you going to kiss me or what? And so we did and that was the last time I'd see her for years. We kept in contact via text for months and just faded away. It was before social media was big so it was literally just a void, no long distance stuff. I met someone else and was with them for many years before we split.

I finally graduated from school, now social media is popular. I found her as she and I have mutual friends. We caught up. I moved back to our home city. We met up - now she was an attorney. Still a step a head. She was proud that I had a degree but I felt ashamed that I wasn't where I wanted to be. I still liked her but I wasn't sure if she liked me.

She actually became a patient of mine after a car accident - my first car accident patient. I was a freaking fledgling chiro and I wasn't even sure if what I was doing helped her. I felt close to her but was still unsure about her feelings towards me.

We sort of keep in contact now. I moved away to a city about 2 hours from her. I am now where I want to be. Car, House - I have my stuff on par with her. Now she's next leveling me and is super fit, and I'm like fuck. I feel like she always raises the bar somehow.

Getting older now and she is too. I know she's single because I literally saw her profile on tinder, I literally had no idea if she was prior to that. Even being social media friends, she's pretty private about her personal life... despite having like thousands of friends on social media now. (I never saw her as such a social butterfly but I think it's because she has an objective).

I had her take the personality test: She tested ISTJ-T
It's not surprising, I like her and really always have.
She has no kids like me, we're both career professionals, obviously there was attraction before any of that transpired.
We have mutual friends, like it all lines up.

Confounding factors include, she knows I've had gfs and remained friends with her and we live in different cities.
From my standpoint - she's obscure and flighty but I've always liked that she was direct when she wanted something.
It's almost like I just want her to tell me what she wants but I can't pry it out of her.
I miss the days when she was like ""so are you going to kiss me?""

How do I approach this confusing woman?"
ESTJ,"Of course I worry. I don't want to hurt or be mean to anyone on purpose, who would be okay with that? Especially my loved ones, how could i not worry about their reactions or opinions?
The key lies in evaluating whether the opinion or reaction you get is valid. Very ESTJ sentence, I know. But is it valid that someone gets, e.g. upset with you for drawing boundaries? mad at you for following your dream and purpose of self? Is it valid that someone gets to voice an opinion on who they think you are, even if its nothing like you?
People are subjective, be aware of that. Don't take everyone as a matter of fact, believe in your judgement or only of those who you trust."
ESTJ,Yeah not to worry about what others may react.
ESTJ,"Hard agree. Why do people think ENTJ assertiveness is cool, but ESTJ is bossy and rude and mean and all of these bad insights."
ESTJ,"Hi Eren,

I would suggest you look into the situations where bossiness/assertiveness come into play. Are they in situations when you need to defend yourself? Situations when someone is not taking the lead? I would suggest going from there.

Next, I don't think you should feel guilty for being bossy. Most of the time I find that my bossiness comes from a place of caring where I want to improve other people."
ESTJ,"Not sure how to answer 'quirky' since I see myself as normal lol. Why do you think they're an ESTJ? Why did you consider the other types? Those two are very different types.

I can paint a general picture if you want: I see the world as right or wrong due to my enneagram flavoring (1w2 so) and commonly criticize the people around me for their opinions and actions. I'm not afraid to do this because of my Te, I make it very well known in arguments using facts and logic that my points are sane, and better. This comes from a place of wanting to protect people though."
ESTJ,"

Thanks for that!

I thought ESTP originally but couldn't quite pinpoint certain things.

Amazing that your family has all those interests.

Oh I read your post before about feeling ""left-out""? Due to bias towards NTs or just N types in general.

It does get rather annoying and I'm sorry you had to go through that. It is very off-putting for new-comers.

I may have been a bit like this when I was younger and new to MBTI... Well fortunately not now.

Hopefully they learn in their own time that all sorts of people have all sorts of things to offer.
And that we're all humans, with hopes and fears."
ESTJ,"Yes, indeed! I've learned to accept my Te+Si, it makes me one hell of a defender ;-)."
ESTJ,Yes.
ESTJ,"Can be friendly! Can be nice. Sometimes I get irritated with SOME INFJs because those particular individuals have a holier than thou attitude - i.e: Go Vegan or Else You're wrong / Mega Feminist / Other BS. That turns me off.

My boyfriend is an INFJ, and he's very much my opposite. Very laid back, a hard worker, but very, very, laid back. I think this is a cultural attitude actually since he is from Brazil. Also, he tends to be very secluded. He makes effort to talk to me, but it feels like it's not enough sometimes."
ESTJ,"We invest time and energy into you by adjusting our life plans to accommodate you.

"
ESTJ,"Why would they stay with you for obligations or tradition lol.

"
ESTJ,Solve their problems ???? brainstorm for a solution over ice cream or something maybe. Helping is caring ??? ???
ESTJ,"Where my life is heading, where it could go. Friends and family."
ESTJ,"

Not sure. I have friends that tell me I live very much in the moment. I like indulging my senses. Music is playing. I cook good food. Despite being over weight right now I can get into habits of exercise where I push myself to the brink, gasping at the end of sessions.

"
INFP,"as a person who spent a good portion of my life doing everything in my power to stifle supress and down right destroy all emotion I have a hard time with it now. I did my absolute best to eliminate it, because for the most part the shear magnitude of negative feelings I had been gathering in my life was going to drive me insane. So I did the one thing that I could do at the time and that was suppress, bury and kill all semblance of emotion. If I wasn't being crippled by it, then I could at least go about doing something about it and work towards a solution.

Now I'm older and life isn't as bad as it was, so I've been trying to really experience emotion again care about things. Let other emotions beside the occasional spot of mindless rage consume my being and steal my ability to reason. What I've come to realise is for the most part, I feel like my emotions don't belong to me. like their some distant thing ignored and suppressed for so long they seem awkward and clumsy and over powering. They erode at the self control, and dedication to reason I have crafted over these many years and I often feel lost.

Unwilling to admit to people I know that I could even feel things deeply, or that anything really matters to me. No one knows me truly and for the most part no one really cares too. Which in some ways is comforting because the notion of somebody getting close enough to actually injure me again and leave that gaping black abyss. That chasm of hopelessness, frustration, and deep sadness, that suffuses my body until I have no choice left but to put most efforts into fighting the feeling. Fearing what it might do to me and what horrible pitiable creature I may become if it's left unchecked.

I feel a bit like a coward, but I realize, that the realization will in fact allow me to confront this issue boldly and with open eyes. This is one of the first time I've really admitted my frustrations, or even having fears or weakness of any sort. I may say I'm wrong but will in general never admit to it being an issue of me as a person being incapable of being right in the situation. Here I think it is an issue of me as a person and I'm going to try and confront this screwed up world of feeling I willingly buried. It scares the living shit out of me, and I don't really know what I'm doing anymore but I'll at least try and if I fail I'll dust myself off and go at it again. After all it's only failure if you accept it."
INFP,"I repress most of my emotions and feelings in real life unless someone taps into the reservoir of anger which sometimes boils over.

I laugh uncontrollably at stupid humor like The Office and the Onion News Network. Sometimes I laugh so hard that I cry. But I never show sadness beyond my normal blank demeanor. At funerals, I don't cry. I just carry a heavy weight in my heart until the sadness yields to my usual melancholic temperament."
INFP,"...It's like I have this great void in me, and then, once there was a bird, gabba gabba, I forget to brush my teeth sometimes, I need to do the laundry and I hate doing laundry, I dunno what I'm gonna eat today, why does nothing ever happen? I eat way too much snacks and junk food and I should exercise more. And the tap water in these apartments really suck, and I can't find that one brand of lactose-free milk that I can actually drink, and I've only been drinking Coke for days, and I like to take long walks and I wish something would actually happen during them, you know this xkcd comic where this guy complains that the empty city at the very earliest hours of morning isn't as good a place to meet people as it should be? I agree. I watched part of this movie called The Bird People in China, it really wasn't anywhere near as good as expected, I'm kinda disappointed but I intend to give it another chance. An ink eraser is an instrument used to remove ink from a writing surface. There are two types: a traditional metal ink eraser, in which the ink is literally scraped off the surface, and the chemically imbibed ink eradicator, in which a vinyl eraser is imbibed with a substance that chemically reacts with the ink to remove it. I spoke to a guy at school today during chemistry class, he didn't seem too friendly or too bright. Me and my roommate are conducting this experiment where we are only talking english at home, and we're swedish. I had a short conversation with a finnish girl, she was nice. Some worker houses from the 19th Century still remain in the area close to the estuary. A substantial Post War Local Authority housing estate was developed in the 1930s. Further local authority housing was developed in the 1970s and in the early 2000s more housing has been built. About 28% of the properties in the area are detached houses with about 36% of the housing stock being semi-detached. I have tinnitus sometimes for weeks in a row, then it disappears. I also have recurring migraines. The wall's moat has also left its mark on London; it forms the line of the street of Houndsditch. This was once London's main rubbish disposal site and was notorious for its appalling odour; its name, according to the 16th century historian John Stow, was derived ""from that in old time, when the same lay open, much filth (conveyed forth of the City) especially dead dogges were there laid or cast."" The moat was finally covered over and filled in at the end of the 16th century, becoming the present street. Is that George Lucas behind the camera? This equipment is fully digital and does not require the use of film. The cameras are activated by a loop embedded in the road surface and will take three pictures. The first and second photographs will show the movement of the vehicle and the third is a close up of the vehicle to determine the make, model, colour and registration number. The time and date will be recorded with each image. These images are down loaded direct to the viewing office for processing via a standard ASDL line. This equipment was type approved by the Secretary of State in May 2003. As is the case of fixed roadside Gatso cameras, there is a requirement to have secondary check marks painted on stretches of road covered by RedSpeed digital speed cameras. The marks are placed exactly one metre apart, so the distance travelled by the speeding vehicle between the two photographs can be calculated. This is done purely as a safeguard for the driver to ensure the speed registered by the camera is accurate. With digital cameras, the speed between the check marks is calculated automatically by the processing equipment. Where there is a discrepancy or the equipment fails to produce the secondary speed check, no action will be taken against the driver. Kyle, your word is ""phylum""...



tl:dr; So lonely, dunno what to do."
INFP,"Ugh, the stuff that's usually on my mind seems to personal to voice. "
INFP,"Okay well... I am going to let some of it out. You don't want it all. Believe me.

I am tired of getting hurt. I am tired of getting emotionally attached to people so easy and then have them rip that away.
Why can't I ever make any friends? It really bugs me. My newest friend has been my friend for six years now. Every time I try...I fail. I will try to take initiative and strike up a conversation. This doesn't ever go anywhere. Is as if once the talk is over, regardless of how long or short it is, it goes back to the way it was prior to the conversation. I really don't like my social awkwardness. It's hard enough talking to another guy I don't know, but when its a girl... I am a complete idiot. I really get that thread about how guys get dumber talking to beautiful women. It really bothers me that for one reason or another the befriending challenge largely extends to even online, where I am much more social. Do people hate me? Am I invisible?

I really dislike my intellegience. I consider myself a dumb INFP. I haven't played an instrament aside a recorder, at least thats what they called it back in 4-6th grade. I like music but I am also very picky on which I like. I can be a decent artist but I have to have a reference, and a bit of time to draw. I don't particularly get any enjoyment out of drawing either. I like working with wood, but the tools for any project I would like to do are a bit expensive. I miss karate, I want to go back into the martial arts. I don't have the time nor money to do so however. I REALLY want to take up archery: not as a sport, just for recreation.
I hate homework. I am in college but in a Junior college. They give much more busy work than normal colleges from what I observed. It is really annoying. I have a horrible memory for specifics. I can't remember names or formula or details in literary work. While as a person I am fine with this, it is a bit bothersome. The details are what everyone expects you to remember. *sigh*

I worry that I wont find a girlfriend again. I haven't gone out on a date in 3 years. I am 22 and have no real strategy on even going about finding one. I can't even seem make new friends so this seems like an impossible task. I really, really, REALLY, don't like my lack of hobbies. I have things I want to do, but unfortunately I can't afford them because I don't have a job. I don't like not having a job. I must have a secret label on my forehead saying ""Don't hire me, I am made of nuclear waste and fail!"" I have been looking, albeit not constantly for a job since my first year out of high school. I graduated in 05 if you were wondering. The town I live next too sucks freaking hairy monkey nuts. Unless you want a job in retail or fast food. Good luck finding anything. I believe this lack of choice is a big part of why I don't get hired, along with my college schedule. I would think an INFP male would be a horrible salesmen. I want to get out of my Junior college already. I am almost done but the classes I need to transfer are stacked in a way that has postponed my transfer be over a year.

I really worry about my future career plans. I have no idea what I want to do. I thought about teacher, but lately all I hear on the news is them getting the short end of the stick.

I feel hollow, or perhaps dead inside. I don't know how you categorize this but. I don't get ""energy from either talking to ""people"" or being by myself. I only feel energized when I am talking or just being around people I care about: which is something in very short supply these days. I feel as if my dreams are becoming more and more distant and distorted as I try to ""compromise"" to get what I want. Occasionally I meet cool people online, but I often wonder where are they in real life? I usually give up because I assume they are in a similar position I am, which means I will have to either be lucky enough to get partnered up with them in a class, or go door by door asking if there is an INFP in the house.

Since about a year and a half ago, I started to laugh quite a bit more. I laugh at just about anything, granted I am comfortable with the company. I do wonder though if I am really happy or just using humor as an emotional high to get over my gloom.
I always feel and think like when talking to the opposite sex, that they probably think I am trying to come on to them. 99% of the time this isn't the case. I need to get over that issue, but I don't know if its just me thinking this or if it really is the case.

Okay, while that was a bunch of negative mumbo jumbo, I figured I would talk about some more positive things, despite being in a sad mood for the past five days. I do like my personality by and large. I like being kind and good. I like having complete faith in my values and morals. I like knowing that when I give my word to someone, I go out of my way to try to fulfill it. I love love, even if I don't get as much as I would like. I look forward to having children some day. I think being a dad would be very rewarding. I like seeing things in a different light from people around me, even other INFPs. I like that I can, at least I think I can, see problems from many perspectives. I had to learn this in my previous relationship to defuse tensions, expand ideas, etc. I really like my dreams, even though some of them can be a bit dark and depressing. I also like the rain, I know, a bit random. I like how my imagination takes off when reading or watching something I really enjoy. I feel as if I am in the reality that I am experienceing.

I would add more but, I am both pressed for time, as I have to start getting ready for class soon, and that I am still a bit depressed(?) about a multitude of things. Not to mention a bit angry at myself for a undisclosed reason. The anger part is legit and I am dealing with it properly, other overwhelming things have just slowed it up a bit i'm thinking.

If any of you feel like saying hi or w/e please do. I come on PC not just for information, but to talk and get to know people. I have to get out of my comfort zone to get things solved, and PC is a nice first step. Almost everyone knows about the personality types, If only people in my area shared the same parallel.

Random thought from just that last part: I should go to school one day with a INFP name tag on my shirt to see if anything happens. Not like I am worried about becoming a social outcast, I am already there! Thanks for reading my rant, thoughts, or whatever you would like to call the abomination above. ^ roud:



I wrote more that I thought >.< sorry."
INFP,I can relate to a lot of this stuff Blueguardian. *man-hug*
INFP,"I feel like one in a million when it comes to accepting people for who they are. My lover even said that he's never ever seen anyone as accepting as I am, and he even has a hard time believing it.

This sucks.. cause there's always people bashing other people and I'm always like, Why? Just let them be.

And that's what on my mind."
INFP,"I lost part of myself several years ago, and have only been going through her vacant motions ever since her disappearance. I have trouble feeling nurturing toward anyone or anything, and overcompensate by giving off the impression of being excessively everything I wish I still were. My heart is dead, and all of my motives are secretly selfish. I am full of pride, and even now while I am writing this, I am thinking about how others will perceive it, hoping they will find my sincerity clever or brave instead of feeling distanced by the magnitude of my previous lack of authenticity. I imagine that being honest about being dishonest could unravel the things I have bound and lift every curtain that hid the emptiness, breaking me open until the room would suddenly fill with light and would give off the illusion of never having been truly vacant. I know better. This illumination reveals the barren walls rather than painting them with substance, and I am nakedly nothing. My temple waits to be refilled, drawing in all of the love I can gather or steal, burning to ashes while providing neither light nor warmth, truth nor love. I worship both, but own neither. In order for one to be effective, I must have both, or else each is rendered dangerous, the inauthentic love of lies or the brutal attraction to loveless truth that only empowers the unloving core. Having no love, I choose to remove truth as well, to avoid the disaster of imbalance. This is the wrong direction, and I know it. I continue my implosion even with awareness of how my disaster is structured."
INFP,"I feel like I've contorted myself beyond recognition. I've had my ability to love and to trust strangled from me by the most prominent influences in my life and to cope I've become something I don't feel is true to me. I can't find any sense of congruency between the way I am and the way the world is. After spreading myself far too thin between people, I've inversed and built a strong wall to keep everyone out. I've tried to free myself by locking myself up from even myself at times, and I'm only now beginning to see the error in this. I'm trying to break free but I can't find the weaknesses in my own fortress. I want now more than ever to experience again true connection, but I'm unable to let more than a small sliver of myself through at any time. I don't even know if the walls were meant to keep me in or to keep everything out, but I know that anytime I get a chance to chip away another day in the real world passes and I'm torn to do mind numbing work and must put myself on hold. It's frustrating and I just want to get away for a very long time to get myself in order, though I fear it's exactly that mentality that got me here in the first place."
INFP,"I often play different roles in video games, but I secretly like shotguns, though I would never admit it

I mean, the shotgun is such an outcast weapon to have, it's short ranged, has a slow firing rate, basically good for game birds or clay pigeons, but damn is it manly

it's so awesome to charge a sniper with it, run from cover to cover while he tries to get me with his sissy rifle then KABLOW I give him a lead salad right in his face haha :laughing:"
INFP,"What the hell am I doing here? Really....do any of you ever think about how completely random life is? Like what in the world......I live on a floating ball that has been here for billions of years.....and has amazing nuances everywhere you look.....I live in america......I am a male......what are the odds? Life is so mysterious....yet how can I be so bored sometimes? Life is so mind boggling. Sometimes I just sit and think ...what the fuck?

I always feel like tearing down the walls that we put up between us. I hate boundaries for some reason. I want to destroy anything false that we feed ourselves to make ourselves feel better..... I feel like an explorer. I want to tear down everything until I get what is real....what is true....and by truth...I guess I mean...what is true within. I guess T's are better at finding the truth of our outside world. I want to know who we are and why we are.

There is the burning feeling inside me.....this tension......that makes me.....almost angry......in fact I am angry. So many questions that are never answered.....but I know that when they are answered....they will not be enough. I am constantly pushing the envelope.....constantly on the edge ....towards the infinite....

This life....pushes me towards an oceanic consciousness.....life without boundaries. This reminds me of Chris McCandless of Into The Wild. He actually ...literally....destroyed his boundaries. He went away ....and said fuck the world....in search of the self...the true self.

Then I ask myself...why? Why the fuck should I even do this? Rationally....it makes no damn sense. It is almost like masochism. Why would you put yourself through the pain of uncertainty in search for a truth that is always one step away.....you will never reach a conclusion you are happy with.....

Yes I am stuck in Fi. I know. But fuck just let me be me for 2 damn seconds before you blast your opinions and perception onto me as if you are God.

Can I say what I feel without you telling me how to live? Can you do that?

I look all around me....and for the most part.....all I see is a bunch of dead cardboard cut outs of each other. Where is your passion? Where are you? Live damnit. Quit being so damn afraid of your emotions. You call me weak? You dare call me weak when every single time you become sad you shut the door like you saw a damn ghost?"

there's a good example right there, language wise! i am all for the making up of words for this reason! language anarchy, WOOOO!

anyway, yeah i definitely feel that way, i've noticed that as i've learnt different foreign languages, it's like i can see the world in a whole new way! it's like looking through differently distorted binoculars or something... and that's part of what i love about foreign languages. just as they say, so much can be lost in translation, and sometimes there's really no translation at all. i hadn't thought about it terms of communicating emotion, but i can totally see that, seems true to me. i've heard english really sucks as a language, lol. i'm just glad i didn't have to learn it as a second language, would be a really crappy language to have to learn i think!! though of course english has it's beauty too.

it's amazing how much is embedded and transfered in language... culture, vision, wisdom... emotion.. and it's also amazing how much language can limit our perception and experience of the world too.

as a side note, i've noticed that many INFPs seem to get along well with people from different countries and cultures, perhaps that ability to empathetically connect helps. or maybe that empathetic connection is necessary to really connect with someone from a different language background, and that ensures depth of relating, which it's probably safe to say most INFPs want, so it makes sense in that way too!"

hmmm, it would be interesting to see the different personality type demographics in different cultures, for sure! but i suspect, like, when we meet foreigners in our own country it might be a sort of forced awareness or consciousness, even if someone's not usually especially intuitive you know? like, they have to be, or it helps to get by if they can develop their intuition when trying to get along in a foreign country, if that makes any sense! like, it helps to get past the language barrier. maybe. just a guess."

English is excellent for emotion, their are several different words for the same thing that each convey a certain emotional connotation. Don't blame the tool for you feelings of inadequacy using it, it does you a disservice and will only lead to further frustration. It's not the languages fault more an issue of having issues translating your emotion into a rational framework. You seem to have issues not with language, or emotion but mainly understanding yourself from a rational prospective. Reason being one of the most direct tools for communication you often feel constricted by your inability to communicate what your really thinking. You know what your really feeling, but feeling is just another type of thought. Thought that you are not consciously aware of, so you need to learn how to figure out what it is your feeling from a rational prospective. Then you can convey your message and the exact emotional connotation through speech and accurate vocabulary. (At least that's what I get from reading your posts.) Don't take it personally, I don't think that it's an issue of being incapable just out of practice. Why would you be out of practice, I don't know. But I know you can do it. It might even make things easier. This is the only post that I really felt I might be able to contribute some helpful advice on so far so I hope it helps."

Understand myself from a rational perspective? I merely spoke about language. How does this translate into me not being able to understand myself from a rational perspective?"
INFP,"While the English language offers a wide variety of word choices to facilitate accuracy, I agree with those who claim it lacks words that adequately describe some experiences within the complete emotional spectrum. Feelings aren't like flavors that can be described as various combinations of a limited range of possibilities like sweet, bitter, salty, sour, or savory. They are more complex than the ways we are affected by the physical senses. What I was feeling the other day had such subtle nuances that no combination of happy, sad, angry, etc. could quite define it or pinpoint its meaning. I struggled to come up with the right word, not because I lack self-awareness or adequate verbal skills, but because the word I needed did not exist. I eventually had to resort to comparisons with physical situations, to describe it symbolically by how it related to other things that were describable. This was especially limiting because it interrupted my train of thought and cut off the feeling I was trying to understand.

This is fair and I figured I was neither clear enough or presented a sound enough case but I may have gotten you to question what the hell it even meant right. Alright so here's my shot at articulating this accurately. Language is merely a tool to convey thought, if you cannot articulate how you feel the most fundamental reason and root reason would be, do to a lack of understanding of what it is you feel consciously. We all understand emotion on the subconscious level, I mean emotion is the subconscious trying to communicate to the conscious mind what it is thinking.

Would you say that you know what you believe but you can't find the right words for it. If this is so, then it probably means that A) One lacks the vocabulary to properly express yourself which I don't think is true in your case. B) One lacks a conscious understanding of exactly what it is that you believe. You know the jist and you get the cliff notes version from the emotional ""feel."" but the things that lead to your subconscious favoring this position still allude you. (The metaphorical you, and this is only a guess.)

If your not aware of the nuts and bolts, then you can't accurately articulate what it is you feel in a meaningful and easy to understand manner. It's not that English lacks the tools, (metaphor, symbolism, correct verbiage, and the tone of the word you are using. Example hurried versus rushed.) I could be completely off base but I thought that was what you where getting at maybe I just have a really hard time seeing things through your eyes. If I offended you it wasn't intentional, it was in no way an indictment of character. It was simply trying to offer a helpful solution to a problem that seemed to have presented itself. (Something I generally can't stop myself from doing.)"

Feelings are not rational. I don't really have an ""issue"". I'm rather offended you took that out of a casual conversation. Though my interpretation could be wrong.

I think my view on feelings and thought is based on MBTI theory.

1. Feeling is a form of judgement that is used in a subjective manner. Using your feelings to guide you will give you a subjective truth....about humans basically. Using thinking will give you an objective truth.....about the world around us bascially. Neither one is superior. To approach feelings from a ""rational view point"" .....I can't really tell you how weird that statement is. Feelings are not rational like I said. Emotions must be understood through feelings.....


....all I can say is study the MBTI. You will find out more about yourself and how you view the world than you ever thought possible. Plus I am not the best teacher.

INFP= Fi Ne Si Te Fe Ni Se Ti

In order to express emotion....you must have something that resembles it ....take a violin....the ocean....the wind.....or a mystery. INFPs are known for using symbols and metaphors to explain what they are feeling. You can't describe emotions from a rational perspective and really understand your emotions. Emotions are understood by your feelings."

This is where you and me differ mostly, feelings are used to identify emotion.... not understand it. All understanding is subjective and the best we can do is to try and be objective. Often we allow emotion to cloud a truth about ourself, through pride or the need to escape an uncomfortable truth. Feeling allows us to understand ourselves because it gives us a readily available way to identify not analyze. That is where reason comes into place, if one has the ability to suspend judgment and question ones emotions. It often allows to understand consciously and rationally what we are feeling. Feelings operate on logic, it may be fuzzy, but their is a cause and effect and understanding behind it. Once these things are identified it becomes possible for one to make changes in them or understand them in others. So yes feelings are part of the puzzle, just as reason is part of the puzzle when it comes to humanity.

Look I'm not talking about standard text book, eliminate incorrect answers logic. I'm talking more along the lines of reason, causal effect relationships. The emotional mind predicts things, interprets things, gives connections and meaning to things. However it has a definite lack of an ability to check if it's explanations are correct or not. That is where reason comes in, it's the part that goes no this won't work this won't work but this one might. Emotions are built around assumptions about the world, that get modified as we live by reason, or by the subconscious mind drawing a connection between two things. An example would be, a black person once pulled a gun on me that threatened my life black people are bad. From a basic standpoint this is correct in the sense that it might alert you to be conscious of a certain group of people that you have had difficulty with in the past. It also over generalizes, assumes black is connected with violence and thus fear. It's a more negative example but an example none the less. The rational mind will evaluate it's accuracy, and look for inconsistencies. You, use your emotions to understand the world, and your reason for ways in which you are wrong. Thus emotion opperates on a set of rules, and reason. It's own logic if you will, it's at times inaccurate but in general effective, that is where reason comes in, it comes up with all of the ways in which you are wrong.

Yes a poem is a use of the english language through words which you earlier stated was not very good at communicating emotion. Conveying an emotion, does not mean getting across the information that emotion was trying to convey to you. You can make someone feel sad the key to that is can you make them understand why you feel sad. That is where knowing the inns and outs of yourself through rational observation and continued questioning plays a vital role. Anyone can make a sad song, artists can make a song that says I'm sad and this is why.


Also...I sense that you are attacking this from a very different paradigm. I am not aware of your paradigm....therefore it is rather hard to debate over this...
I attack everything from a different paradigm because I in fact have a broken head.:laughing: But yeah most debates tend to be based on people looking at something with vastly different experience bases. As well as having vastly different definitions of what is what."

Ok about the last thing you just said...because this is very important. I can sense we both have very different biases and definitions of what is what.

My next function is Ne. This is how I perceive the world around me...through extroverted intuition. I see things and connect dots...kind of like a web chart....or a bracket system.

Now...when you tell me that I need to understand my feelings through logic....and that feelings are based on logic....this makes no sense to me based on the dots I have connected.

Feelings or logic makes sense of your intuition or senses. N and S are perceiving functions. T and F are judging functions. So.....understand your F through your T? That makes no sense in my paradigm. Therefore I am confused.

I think what your saying is....( I could be COMPLETELY wrong but this is my guess) ....that.....in our cognitive functions.....Fi Ne Si Te Fe Ni Se.....we should use our inferior Te to make sense of our Fi. ....maybe

It actually did my comments are not based on MBTI or it's definition of thinking and feeling, (feeling is just another type of thinking so the labels are inaccurate, misleading and foolish.) my definitions are based on articles and books on the topic of cognitive science I have read. As well as a life time, of trying to understand people, and the world. Both in an intensive quest to in some way understand myself and conquer whatever demons remain in me to be the type of person I want to be. I think that making a decision based sole on emotion is a truly bad way to make decisions. I also think that no decision is ever made using thinking. Thinking only disqualifies options it does not produce them. (One of the reasons feelers are so much more positive about things and people. They create stuff, and often get cynical and set in their ways when someone says that it isn't of merit. They often then become thinkers or alienate themselves from criticism, with an attitude of you can't say my feelings aren't right because you can't truly prove anythings not right.) Feeling and the subconscious are interlinked, they create things, (By create I in no way mean actually create from nothingness I mean re-shape.) give explanations and connect the dots. Reason points out when something is wrong, that's the conscious' gift to humanity. I identify myself as INFP not because the tests tell me so, it's because I relate holy and completely in my core values and beliefs with what is important to them. My interest in people makes me an INFP, my obsession with mastering myself, questioning myself, and treating the world with an even minded compassion.

Now I always, and I mean always make sure to see if whatever crazy crap my brain comes up with is thoroughly tested by reason.

One is crippled without the other, emotion and reason. Emotionless reason is what a computer or robot can do perfectly. That's the one end of the scale, the other is the religious zealot, the madman, the fool, the child that refuses to grow up. One does nothing but eliminate possibilities, the other does nothing but make connections. Everything can be connected, in a million different ways, it's reasons job to eliminate the connections that do us no good. That do not stand up to the rules of the world we live in, that is how I define each. The only truly optimized members of society are the ones who realize this. It's a process of trying to gain the best of both world's. A truly rational person is never truly right because they never venture anything only tear down. They never ever prove themselves right only prove that others are wrong.

The truly enlightened know next to nothing because they know that nearly all things can be dis proven. It's the ability to leap from that understanding to the idea that somethings should be believed to be true, because if they are not they will physically hurt us, and if they are not true it makes no difference. (And recognise which these are based on the world we live in.) That I think makes one truly in touch with both sides, and allows both sides to flourish most prevalently. I think that people who Identify themselves as feelers, need to at least be familiar with this process, that just because it can be right doesn't mean it is. We need people to say yeah you're wrong, here's why. Then we need to consciously detach ourselves from what we have done in order to evaluate whether what has been said is in fact true.

I think that's where feelers get themselves bit in the ass, instead of going yeah but how about if I changed this around, they go. No! that's not true and I find it insulting that you said what I have made is in no way useful. By extension calling me useless, no they are saying that is incorrect under these conditions please try again or notify me of conditions being met.

INFP,"
It actually did my comments are not based on MBTI or it's definition of thinking and feeling, (feeling is just another type of thinking so the labels are inaccurate, misleading and foolish.) my definitions are based on articles and books on the topic of cognitive science I have read. As well as a life time, of trying to understand people, and the world. Both in an intensive quest to in some way understand myself and conquer whatever demons remain in me to be the type of person I want to be. I think that making a decision based sole on emotion is a truly bad way to make decisions. I also think that no decision is ever made using thinking. Thinking only disqualifies options it does not produce them. (One of the reasons feelers are so much more positive about things and people. They create stuff, and often get cynical and set in their ways when someone says that it isn't of merit. They often then become thinkers or alienate themselves from criticism, with an attitude of you can't say my feelings aren't right because you can't truly prove anythings not right.) Feeling and the subconscious are interlinked, they create things, (By create I in no way mean actually create from nothingness I mean re-shape.) give explanations and connect the dots. Reason points out when something is wrong, that's the conscious' gift to humanity. I identify myself as INFP not because the tests tell me so, it's because I relate holy and completely in my core values and beliefs with what is important to them. My interest in people makes me an INFP, my obsession with mastering myself, questioning myself, and treating the world with an even minded compassion. The INFP is the epitome of a person who seeks honor in their person and does their best in the world for every one they can. I was born an INFP, I grew up an INFP, I adapted to life.

INFP,"first thing popping into my mind, i apologize in advance:

i sometimes feel frustrated with the world, because everyone knows whats going on but no one acknowledges it. we waste our time being fake to try and impress everyone else, and some people work so hard at it. many people have given up and they feel like their lives are worth nothing, and i wish i could save them and make them see how beautiful they and their lives are and could be. And under all this, it just comes down to the fact that all anyone really wants in life is to love and be loved.

i suppose this really shows just how much of an INFP i am haha, with this idealism i never really realized, and i'm always dreaming of impossible things that should be common sense. the world is much simpler than people make it out to be."

Sometimes I can't stop myself, especially under pressure like this. Is that old friend of mine who I think hates me for no reason gonna be there? Will my friends get along with everyone? Will they have a good time? Will the food be good? Will I have to open presents in front of everyone? Will I appear gracious and kind or aloof and distracted? Will I be able to answer everyone's probing questions? Will I appear like I have it all together or will I look like a scatterbrain space case?

Suffered true ""cabin fever"" for the first time, gave me insomnia not to mention the symptoms of the flu itself.

Still feeling somewhat alien, getting used to talking again, walking around and actually living.

Despite being predisposed to avoiding/surviving without human contact, turns out it was the one thing I needed the most whilst I was sick... even more than a remedy for the obvious physical ailments.

I even wish I had online friends.. How do you go about making friends online? It just happens I guess. I had online friends when I was about 12. I remember this one older guy who called me mature for my age.. but he would always tease me for being young. I also had an American penpal and a guy from an online game I played. I wonder where they are now... I just wish I had someone to say anything too.

I wish I didn't kind of hate one of my friends for having changed so much and I wish I didn't feel so jealous when she talks about her boyfriends. I hope my best friend's life gets better soon, and I hope she gets some free time for me so we can play video games like when times were simpler.

INFP,"Near all my friends have all left uni for this year to go back home recently. They all promised they wouldn??t forget me when they came back next semester, but I just can??t shake the feeling they will anyway. I??m staying in Halls for another year; when asked I say it's due to this gut disease I have, but in truth, it??s because nobody asked me to live with them. Another friend ?? who could likewise hide behind an illness as an excuse, will be spending his final year and third time in Halls. Nobody has asked him either. I see myself in that. I see how much it bothers him, and nobody else seems to or at least don??t care; they think he??s boring and always sarcastic because that??s who he is, and not what ??they?? have turned him into. And I note that his first-year friends haven??t stuck around much either. :dry:

Before he left for home, another friend came around and was prepared to listen to how I was doing: making myself accountable. He asked if I could see any changes in myself over the year to compare with. I noted that I was basically socially inept and friendless, and that now one of the two was not the case. He replied that a mark of growth was the conversation we were having and that I was sustaining a conversation, being open about myself. And I raged inside. A month ago I gave him the most personal leverage over myself and I can??t believe it took him this long to check up on me. This wasn??t a conversation it was an interrogation. I was trying to tell him how angry I was with God and with people at large; and all the flights of emotion and rage that every night I can so easily summon, failed me. I don??t think he could see or feel how much this bothers me, or even what the hell was bothering me, even with all I told him. I so desperately wanted him to know, for him to help; and that if he couldn??t, it was my fault.

My parents keep telling me to get a job, but I have enough money at the moment and I don??t see the need. All I can see is people coming home from work, tired and unhappy. And because of it, they can??t help each other; in fact they are all just making it worse. And now we??re strained. It??s like we??ve all lost something, and they are relying on me to link them all, whilst at the same time constantly asking me to sabotage what??s holding us all together. They??re always trying to force me into a mould of some kind or another. They keep telling me they??re worried that when I??ll come home, I??ll ??regress?? into my ??older?? self: quiet, friendless, useless ?? as if I was less of a son when I was with them. But some terrible things happened to me, especially with my health, and I don??t see how anyone could have done any better: and now they define me by it, when that was when I needed their help. They never seem to ask why I was even more quiet, or ask where my ??friends?? were when I fell ill.

I feel like such a failure of a son, I wish I was closer to my Dad, and that I could impress him more. I know he loves me, but when together, all he does is tell me where I??ve failed and what I should be doing, who I should be. I can??t remember the last time he said something nice about me. I feel awful that I can??t; that I could even think of the family like this - there's a lot that's great about it, but it's not been the same recently. I can see how much he??s hurting as well, and I wish Mum would make things easier for him. It seems ridiculous: he wants to be closer, I want to be closer, why the hell isn??t this happening?!"
INFP,"I honestly cannot believe the kinds of attitudes some people hold. I cannot believe the kinds of things that go on on this planet.

I hate this process of truly getting to know the world without rose tinted glasses on. This gradual loss of ideals and innocence is so heartbreaking. And it is abhorrent to me, that other people could have the nerve to attempt to cut you down for caring. Because... well fuck. Maybe you learned early on what life is really like, and it didn't hurt because you don't care. Well I fucking care, and it's not wasted energy. Because I at least treat the people around me with a bit of dignity.
Life's a game, eh? life's a joke? sure it may seem like that. But people get hurt. That pain is real. Don't fucking tell me their lives are a joke. Just because you don't care, has no say over the worth of these people.

I can't believe that you emailed me and apologized. Usually, I would be extremely happy get an apology but, honestly, after all that you put me and our mutual friends through, I can't accept it. I know that you haven't changed - you have no clue what you are apologizing for because, fundamentally, you can only understand your own emotions - not yourself as a person, only your overwhelming emotional reactions to things. You're apologizing not because you're truly sorry, but because your very extroverted self is getting lonely. You rely on your good looks and your happy, flighty personality to get away with things - I'm sorry, I've very clearly seen through that and it's not worth it. It was extremely difficult for me to stand up for myself and push you away. I fucking cried when I had to tell you that I needed space in my own house - you knew that I was an introvert and you knew very well what that implied and yet you acted like I was wrong for making you leave me alone for more than like 10 minutes a day. You never asked to stay at my house - you just invited yourself in and took over my life and I let you because I wanted to help you out but, my god, you never considered me and you would have never moved out if I didn't have the courage to stand up to you. My mum is an ENFP and she has been in many similar (and worse, much worse) situations and she told me she was proud of me for speaking up for myself (once I told them my parents what was happening). You leeched off me mentally, academically (you made me basically write your 2-3 months late paper which you did no research for), emotionally and ... I just can't. I can't.

Also, I know that you are one of the only friends she ^^ has left and that I shouldn't complain about her ^^ in front of you, but, again, you also fucked me over -- much more deeply and over a longer period of time. It is amazing that I'm as nice and civil as I am towards you. Honestly, I have little compassion for you in what was at best a moderately awkward situation. I'm more sorry that I made other people feel awkward during this conversation.

I'm such a push over - I can't, can't, can't be like that anymore. All these things keep happening to me and I let them happen. (it's very unfortunately that both these people are the only ENFJs I know - it makes me unfortunately biased against the type).

... I'm afraid it'll happen again though.

I'm feeling quite emotional right now. I seem to have a certain period of time every couple of days where I feel *everything* more.

NatalieAnne - I'm so happy that you've found some peace of mind on this thread. Thank you for making it.

In fact, I am incredibly, incredibly happy that I found PerC. That we can talk about anything and be so different and yet so similar.

Actually, ever since I did my second vlog, I feel more at ease, less anxious about feeling judged and unwanted on this site. I still feel like that (hard to stop totally thinking like that, no matter how much you try and break the habit), but the feeling has lessened. I mean, I can't expose myself anymore than that, can I?"

Hey Helena, I don't want to cut your wings but a lot of the comfort you have in your life now is provided by structure. Just imagine you'd have to work on a field everyday or go collect berries just to survive. Sure you'd still be free but in order to survive youd have to focus on resource gathering. In society now that is outsourced so you don't have to. But the downside is that this complex society needs certain rules. For example the bus schedule.

Don't worry Helena, if there's any place on here where you don't have to make perfect sense, it's here.

I think I can understand what you mean, if it counts for anything. You want to carve your own life. Someone once told me 'freedom' is a state of mind; a state of being. Sometimes freedom is not what you think it is. Important thing is, that you create it. Fearlessly. Because living life on your own terms, is the hardest but most worthwhile pursuit. Don't be afraid to let the journey take you somewhere, don't be afraid to see your vision change. Just go with it.

Living life on your own terms IS the hardest and most worthwhile pursuit, but there aren't many 2nd/3rd chances in that way of living. When I say ""way of living"" I mean, your physical life - your finances, your health, your relationships. Usually those things are very difficult to repair once you damage them. For example, money lost and spent is lost and spent. Or, my lungs will forever be damaged by drugs and smoking. My friends and family will always remember the lies I've told and how I've hurt them.

If you live life according to the terms of others, life is easier because if you ever hurt someone or just did something wrong (a wrong that's palpable, tangible), it's easier to be forgiven for it by others, and people will help you right your wrongs because you were doing it to satisfy someone else. Maybe that person who's helping you out of the hole you're in - maybe you're living by that person's terms.

But if you stand in the shadow of no man, you will most likely not receive the help and support of anyone either. Or at least not as much if you chose to stand with the majority. In that sense, I've been really lucky because in my efforts to ""live on my own terms"" I've messed up big time many times and yet, have managed to get away with it or have someone else fix up my problems.

Now, there are of course some people who can make it on their own, as their own. You know who they are, and it's superfluous to mention them here.

I hope I made sense writing this. I'm not good at doing anything logical. But I try, you know? I try to be logical. It's a wonder I even get through essays at Uni.

I don't think being an INFP is anything special. Well, the wrongs I've done, as multitudinous and varied as they are, although they can be tied back to my INFP personality, are not really that unique - lots of people of other personality types have committed them. Some have gotten away with it, some have not. And most people spend their lives trying to fix those things they've done wrong. Some try to do it on their own terms (live on their own terms, I guess?) and some try not to do any more damage and just live their lives as commonly as possible. Some become great, some succeed and some do not. Whatever it is, most people are encumbered in some way or the other by the crimes they've committed. Popular crimes.

I hope I made sense here (aka I know I didn't, but just pretend that I did :frustrating"

Yes, if you decide to 'live on your own terms', you must be prepared to have only your two feet to stand on.

I have attempted 'creating' my own freedom, and I fucked up. Big time. Like you, I luckily had people to fall back on. I have no doubt that if there is a next time, they wont be there.

Searching for ""freedom"" is never what you think it will be. It's not sunshine, lollipops and rainbows. It's not a means to an end. There is no end. It's a constant negotiation. It's rough, and it's dirty. Sometimes, your ideals are misguided too.

I've lived on the cusp of 'society', in a sense i'm doing it right now. And my personal conception is that the only way to live on my own terms is not an extreme change of setting or social contract, but it is through the means of my own mind; through my thoughts, attitudes, feelings and emotions. Through accepting and knowing the real world. And negotiating my way through it, with courage. Not that I don't think experience can't effect this process- of course it can. That said, my conception of living life on my own terms, may be different from a lot of other peoples', and indeed the attitudes of those with extroverted preferences. This is just the 'insight' a long period of isolation has given me personally.

Let fire off some quotes:

""Love is a process""
""Love - everytime it's different.""

I guess that sums it up. Since it's a process it cannot be pure since it's always changing and evolving. So you have to be on your toes and go with the flow. Dreaming about it is nice but then you are stuck in the past or possible future but not the present where the process actually happens.

Completely agree... I pretty much see sexism everywhere, especially in ads. I don't understand why it's never a guy who needs a fantastic mop to clean the house; it's always the ladies who are cleaning... I know that the ads are aimed at a particular market (housewives from the 40's apparently) but seeing a man clean his house would not make me less interested in buying a cleaning product in fact, I'd probably wouild want to encourage a smart-enough company to portray men as people who actually clean up after themshelves (they exist..right?)

Right now I have no one who I call my ""Best Friend"" and yes, I feel lonely from time to time, but... somehow I felt as though I'm used to it. It's happened when parents put me into the mainstream school full-time, and my interpreter, aside from writing on notes, was my only link to communication. Those years in the middle school have convinced me that loneliness is just a part of my life. Thankfully, though, my family is Deaf, unlike many others. So that's one of the things I'm grateful for. One of the reasons why I'm afraid of complaining so much.

...Okay, maybe I really don't like that kind of lonely feeling in real life. Not really.

Wish I would have been more assertive.


And this whole thing made me realize not everyone will come to rescue you when you're drowning. After all, they're all just people with their own battles to deal with, just like us."
INFP,"I painted last night. it felt really good. running in water, also testing the elements of family and friends, breathing in bicycles while eating squid sandwiches. dean, smashing colors against my grey soul.

ugh... my mind is a poetic shitstorm of thoughts, when everyone else speaks monotone peaceloss, can anyone try to find a time to not ryhym.

this would be a lot easier if my mind didn't have holes, and I could think of what to write before I put it down, but I am just writing, writing, repeating, and doing an exercise that I was feeling, then I blankly leave and return with nothing, from a place that solves nothing, and place worth losing, maybe, or not, I will never know because I will never show visible signs of the world you can't see, cause I was never there to you, but was there to me, I was there, and now I can't be, because of these holes in my mind that do not let me see"
INFP,"Pissed when my ESXJ mother goes form talking about everything in such detail i want to put a pile driver through my head and connecting me fixing dinner with how horrible people at work treat her, then how she did blah blah blah in the 10th grade, then how she wants me to do another thousand things for her and her being vague and expecting me to understand the statement ""check to make sure the vacuum back isn't to full"" actually means ""check the vacuum bag, dont throw it out, sprinkle deodorizer all over the carpet, and then vacuum it up to get rid of fleas""."
INFP,"I can go for a few days, feeling great, feeling proud of myself, disciplined, confident, on the right track and then I will be overtaken by the urge to destroy all my progress. Just today, after a successful week of eating well and not consuming alcohol in a vain attempt to be healthy, I went to lunch, ordered a giant cheese sampler plate and am so full I could pop. And at this very moment, I am fantasizing about getting drunk and rowdy. Neither thing is healthy and I know it yet I can't stop myself. I am so impulsive. It's like something in my mind won't let me be successful. I can't always be good, I can't always be healthy, even if I want/need to. I have to sabotage it. Set myself back. What the hell? There's always a catch. There's always a self-imposed end to a good streak. I cannot be good. I must be bad. I am bad.

What do my fantasies tell me about myself these days? That I want to be bad. I want to be a badass. I want to be clever and witty. I want to be mischievous, mysterious, seductive, raunchy. Yet I can't even bear to wear a low cut top without feeling self-conscious. My own mind won't let me fantasize about bad things without censoring it. The only time I can be bad is when I stop thinking and act impulsively. Perhaps that's why it comes in spurts, it's buildup, like a wet dream. Everyone needs to let out a little bad sometimes, I suppose. Mine just happens to occur without my permission, like an invasion. Uncalculated and spastic. I'm an angel for a week and then, look out!

I sound like I'm proud of this, but I'm not. It's my least favorite thing about myself. I'm reserved, I'm deliberate, I'm a good person. But then suddenly, I see my hand reaching for something evil, something that will destroy me and humiliate me. And I don't stop it. I let it go. It feels right, it's called ""living in the moment"" right? Isn't that what they tell you to do these days? Live in the moment? So I live for the moment and I am loving it. Next day comes and I feel like a piece of trash and I vow never to do it again. Don't know how many times I've told myself ""never again!"" and I'm successful for a short time, then it's like my short term memory fades and I'm right back at it, thinking it's a good idea. Perhaps this is what they call an ""addictive personality""? I don't know. You can only be calm for so long before you explode.

And I was in a good mood today. So quickly I change."
INFP,"I... HATE... cats... one of the neighbour's cats just came and killed three of my birds, including my old Princess Parrot... poor things... ive always hated cats but now this's just... argh... the thing i hate about cats the most is they are the only animal, apart from humans, who kill purely for ""fun"" all other animals at least eat what they kill, they do it to survive, but cats just kill for fun the little bastards... they're pure evil, just look at them, they're sly and sneeky and suspicious and it seems like im the only one who sees it, everyone else just thinks they're ""cute innocent little bundles of fur..."" Im at the point of just killing a cat the moment i see it... Thats the other thing i hate, its killed like, 7 of my birds, but no one will give a shit if i complain, but i kill the cat and its all going to court and animal cruelty... to me, cats are the pure embodiment of evil inn the natural world... and i HAATTEE them with all my heart..."
INFP,"I know you are extremely busy, with your dad being sick, your job, your summer classes and your family that makes you do all of the housework...but thank you. Thank you for going to bed later then you should have tonight, I missed talking to you and it made my day. Can't wait to see you tuesday and good luck on your exam monday ^^

Not really a rant but we can say nice things here too right? XD"
INFP,"That sounds like something might say to my friend...

if she was online >:-O

Haven't spoken to her on MSN in over a week. My INFP doubts are getting the better of me, starting to feel like I've done something wrong."
INFP,Why can't people see that all it takes for a peaceful world is understanding?
INFP,"
I would be elated if you could prove ME wrong.
The burden of proof falls upon the believer.

I honestly could praise myself for how right I am when it comes to pinning people's actions and their intentions, but It just leaves me hurt before anything actually happens.

...I don't even know where to go on from there. It just leaves me so______."
INFP,"That was hectic, but things at last worked out. She's finally willing to talk to me, now that we understood each other's sides. However, I'm not going to lie and say that nothing was lost after all what have happened. Even though I think we might be on good terms, I doubt we'll be able to be as close as before (that doesn't mean i'm unwilling to try, though). Too many hurts happened. Trust will have to be regained bit by bit. That's gonna take a while. For now it'll probably be awkward whenever we see each other again.

I suppose... I do still feel remorse. Apologies have been issued, but sometimes I feel I should have known better than that. And due to this, our relationship kind of went awry at this point. But I will do my best to be a better friend. To start that, I'm leaving her alone until she feels ready to talk to me again. However long it takes."
INFP,"it summer now and i'm out of school, but i don't feel anythin but a slightempty feeling, like every year i commited myself to getting girls and being a better person, and i sorta failed on both fronts. i didn't get a girl this year, al the ones i liked weren't interested in a realtionshpi with anyone, which puts me in a odd spot because as an INFP i'm used to completly blaming myself nd for once it's completly not my fault.and wit the oher goal all i've reallized is how painfully different i am even from my best friends."
INFP,I feel like a bad person...
INFP,"

seeing this just gives me a wave of empathy, i wish there was something i could say to it. without even giving a reason you're a bad person?i kno the infp self doubt moments come and go, but you can always open up here-noone will judge you"
INFP,"
I thought exactly the same and started to write a PM, but it's so vague I gave up. Were I sober I'd have gone through with it - I'm really concerned too."
INFP,"
I'm on a self doubt peak right now. Feel like shit roud:"
INFP,"
After much contemplation and comparison to people and the world at large I've come to one the conclusion that I'm one of three things:

A living an anachronism

A psychopath

Or something completely broken with no hope of repair.

The truly hilarious part of all of it is since I don't know where to go from here, so I'll remain in a state of constant listlessness until I or the planet expires.




..........meh"
INFP,"I'm more and more frequently feeling that my stability/happiness is extremely dependent on my meds and is therefore artificial. As much as I like having equilibrium and feeling sane, sometimes I try to force myself into feeling more - to bring back the depths of sadness and anxiety that I'd previously felt.
I know that I don't actually want to go back to the way I was, but I can't help but want more emotion in my life. I'm fundamentally a being that feels, as we all are, and sometimes I want the lows as well as the highs."
INFP,"I'm inspired to do another one. In her facebook picture she is lying down with him in the grass in the sun where we used to go, very near where he broke up with me. He is grinning and her arms are exposed and scarless. Yeah, you do get over people, fucking quickly. Everything we went through, our whole relationship is meaningless to you now. You've forgotten me already. How nice for you. This makes me want to hurt again. Am I selfish? I never clung to you, though I needed to. I let you go, and you don't look back. I can't hate you, whatever you did, I want you to be happy. But do you never remember? I'm so tired of pretending to myself that I'm ok and you treat me so flippantly. You said 'you need to distance yourself' to get over shit. Well I know how you got over me. But I still feel like I'm there with you, a ghost that you can't see. You are perfect together. I am watching the last remnants of my life, and they have no awareness. And yet when I look at you, you are tired and sad. I wanted you to know me. There will never be another chance. It is all over."
INFP,"My father is a heavy duty alcoholic and it is getting worse. I now don't even like spending time with him because he is always wasted and just plain and simply not functioning. He is drinking at work (hes a dentist) and losing business, and now my dad is running short of money. The bad thing is, my dad won't stop. He just doesnt think its possible and he won't even remotely try to something better for himself, he is just giving up. It fucking pisses me off. I don't really know my dad anymore, but now on the path he is going, I need to prepare myself for his death, because I know it may be soon. He is just drinking himself to death"
INFP,"

I didn't except any repercussion, but your reply really made me smile....
Sometimes I just feel that I'm not enough, that I could be more....and sometimes my past just deeply haunts me. I hope there was some way from getting free from haunting past, but... there isn't. I'm still learning...and yeah... I'm living for the first time, isn't that a good excuse!?
Today was better than yesterday, so... once again progress has happened.
Oh...and thank you for your empathy It really made me feel better.


I thought exactly the same and started to write a PM, but it's so vague I gave up. Were I sober I'd have gone through with it - I'm really concerned too."
INFP,"I think I'll start by the weather...why the hell is it so hot??? Its higher than 50 C in the afternoon and 40 C at night.

And why are we taking our exams in over a month?? I'm sick and tired of waking up every single day and studying, I feel like my head's going to explode, and that if I tip it sideways all the information would fall out...my head does feel heavy a bit...

And why the hell can't anybody accept that I'll never be outgoing and open to everyone?? I accept everyone as they are but nobody accepts me for what I am, and never was I understood and/or encouraged and comforted in the way that works with me.

....whew...at least I got that out. Time to go and study."
INFP,"I really don't understand my mood swings sometimes... I felt ok yesterday. life didn't seem too bad (except for my major insomnia...). Today.. I just have this weight on my heart for no apparent reason... I barely eat anymore, perhaps it's the heat but I really don't feel like eating. I feel empty, and not just in the ''I don't have any food in my stomach'' way. It's probably that wanting to be loved and to love feeling again that has been missing from my life since oh forever. Damn..."
INFP,"I had a very very weird dream. Where I was a chick, and I was experiencing an orgy with all my friends. It wasn't arousing in any way shape or form, it was just flat out weird. -Shakes head- I don't know what to think of it."
INFP,A few days ago I had a dream where I got shot in the chest for telling an italian american man to shut up on a plane. Your dream sounds more fun.
INFP,"depression seems to be absolutely ingrained within me due to the way i think, the things i notice, and the constancy of my thinking and feeling. i dont think meds will help. now i just have a headache all the fuckin time and i feel like... im stuck under some annoying veil. i keep feeling like i have an itch somewhere, but i cant scratch it, cuz its like... under the skin. and i just feel... flat and shitty like i used to feel back when i took ritalin. just... bitter and tired and cranky, but with a constant headache on top of it.

After trying to explain ""myself"" to a ""friend"" he recommended seeking medical help since he wasn't ""qualified in helping someone who 'felt' like they were in this position."" Since then, I've come to the conclusion that seeking ""medical"" help for whatever this is, is a self defeating act that'll wind up being a huge waste of time.

So fuck people and all of their ""help."""
INFP,"Sorry, I havnt really been reading this thread at all so I dont know what is going on, but I just had to write this somewhere - hopefully it will annoy me less that way.

Just had a day out with a friend where we hung out in town. The day was reasonbly fun, and yet I feel so unfufilled. Infact when I was walking home I felt even more sad than I was before I left. Argh, sometimes I wonder why I just cant be happy.

Perhaps it has something to do with what this supposed 'friend' said. Yes, I am reclusive, boring and emotionally distant. He decribed it as 'safe'. Ok, sure, I acknowledge that I dont take some risks that other people dont even consider, but does that make me less of a person, less of a human. Does it mean I like living less? Well he seemed to think so - I was compared to a turtle. The thing is, Im not really denying any of it as it is pretty much all right, and maybe its the realisation of this that has made me sad. Have I let, well, essentially me get in the way of possibility? Of potential? Do I regret these oppertunities that I have missed?

Ugh, I dont really think that Im making too much sense at the moment. My head is a flurry of questions.

Now, I dont want any pity or anything. I just needed to get this out somewhere. Think it of me shouting into a tunnel - I just needed to let it out, Im not expecting anything back.

Blah."
INFP,"I try not to let my mind wander to there...But I want to! Stop me. I like it here. Well, I like the idea of it. Am I imaging again?Don't let me get too comfortable. Is this okay? ...........

INFP,Whatta weekend with all my more or less dear friends. And now I'm drained. But I've stlll got some social things to do :frustrating:

INFP,The ring came off my pudding can !
INFP,"I am dead. I've been dead for a long time, it seems. The world leers at me. How can I smile? It took from me when I was young, made me want to hide myself forever because it was unspeakable. I wanted to die so badly. The word 'shame' was one I couldn't ever speak, I still find it hard, it means so much. I can't cope with the intensity. If I see a flicker of love in someone's eyes, it makes me want to run away. Sometimes I can't breathe. But I hold my head up and laugh, waiting to turn around the next corner to a place where things are better, where people might not hate me. But this path just carries on, there is no end and I am still the same, but I am becoming more ugly, more evil, more repulsive, more selfish, I can't show myself, there are things I have to push to the side and hide so no-one will find out. They'd be disgusted. I can't help but think I must have lost myself somewhere on the way of forgetting. Three layers of fakeness, hollow inside. But I know I haven't really forgotten. I can't escape from myself. I want to bleed, but that would be giving in, and I'm scared it'll go further. I'm so selfish to have written all this about myself.

Anyway, things will get better. The past is called 'the past' for a reason, I guess. Thank you for making the thread, NatalieAnne. Even though I've been bitchy/incontent in all my posts, it feels so incredibly good to get all this out, and I can't believe some of you have been through some of the same things and feel alien too, I wish I could help everyone out, but at least it's nice to know that no-one is utterly alone. :blushed:"

INFP,"A listless INFP's stream of pathetic consciousness. My own self-pity makes me want to puke. But, I don't particularly care if it bothers anyone else, because perhaps someone can relate.

Affection
Can't get enough
Always feeling
Lacking
Lonely
Angry that I can't fix anything about myself
Because I don't try
I know so much about self improvement
But I don't try

I have no motivation anymore
I don't even have motivation
To play my guitar
Or get up and eat
Or clean my room, which has mice crawling around everywhere
I just lay here
Listening to depressing music
Feeling blank, with a headache
The only thing that motivates me at all
Is the chance to see my girlfriend
And nothing else matters

The light at the end of the tunnel
Is moving to Washington for college
That is the thing that keeps me looking forward day after day
The relief from this bland life I lead
This house is a poison
That seeps deep into
My soul, every inch of my body
Making me tired and weak
Heavy, listless
Everyone living in this house is disgusting
Pick up your garbage you disgusting pigs

I want to go enjoy the busy-ness of the world
But I am stuck in this gray, cluttered box
Retreating to the confines of my twin sized mattress
Day after day, hour after hour
Minute after grueling minute
I stare at this computer screen
With nothing to do
Nothing to occupy my mind or my time

I could get out of bed and change things
But I am glued to this mattress
I want someone to read this and to
Come save me from my laziness
But no one will
I know that"

I'm lucky that my main NT friend understands that I approach things from a different perspective - she doesn't tolerate people using emotions to excuse stupidity but she understands my mind is a strange, messy place because of my Ne. Also, she has the same understanding as me that human beings are necessarily subjective - we are biased, we are emotional and rational, we are embedded in a social sphere that is complex. Things are not as neatly logical as some NTs like to assume and if they are, they're rarely useful in the real world because the real world is not prone to neat logical solutions. I think that being aware of your subjectivity is actually smarter and less arrogant than assuming you're capable of objectivity (not that you can't be more objective but you have to realize that can never actually achieve true objectivity).

Actually, I have felt empowered by my Fi - it gives me motivation, strong opinions, intellectual drive. I see nothing wrong with having core values - and anyone who tells you otherwise is silly.

Sorry, complexity and subjectivity etc are some of my pet subjects. :blushed:"

I'm kind of in a good mood right now since I just talked to a very nice girl. Not in person of course. There's always a catch.

Yeah I have felt empowered in the past too and still have streaks of ignorant bliss. But the thing is if I want to do anything then I have to get out of that and into the meaninglessness of the real world. And that's like an invisible barrier at the moment that I'm stuck in. Either happy, carefree and kinda useless or disillusioned and without energy and equally useless.

The quote out of the 2nd Matrix Movie sums it up for me:

Morpheus asks the council member in the machine hall if he wants to prove a point. And the council member answers. I'm an old man. I no longer want to prove points. Because there is no point.

That kind of is the state of affairs for me. And I assume for a lot of other INFPs in this thread. If you have an answer to where to get some purpose from. I'm listening!

I'm in the process of trying to get a GF but I know that won't make me happy either since that too is temporary.

So how to focus the FI to get maximum results?"
INFP,"
So would you say that a balance between the rational mind and the emotional mind are necessary to truly attain wisdom? If so, how do you balance the two of them? When do you use one and when the other? Maybe im asking too many questions that cant be answered...answer if you can though! By the way your response has been duely appeciated roud:
haha, I'm not sure. I would hate to speculate for people in general. I have just noticed that Fi - my investment in the truth, in justice, in equality and other values that I hold dear, can drive me intellectually. Being invested in a topic, however, can colour your perspective - and not necessarily in a good way. I think the key is self awareness when it comes to intellectual and well as personal matters - understand where you're being completely irrational in your beliefs but not dismissing them out of hand as a useless subjective, emotional reaction.

Sigh - I have no idea :frustrating:"

INFP,"I was told that I was more mature compared to people who were older than me. I don't feel anywhere near as mature as I would like to be.
One more month until I turn 21. I feel that just because I can does not necessarily mean I should. I don't see a reason to. There are way too many things I need to sort out in life first and I don't need another distraction.
I had to revert back to nocturnal status because my brother changed his sleeping pattern back to ""normal"". It is now the only time I have access to my own laptop and PerC furthermore. I miss sleeping during the night.
I miss my ""sick"" voice. It sounds so much deeper and much more charming. More people seem to smile whenever I have that voice.
Speaking of voices, someone suggested I should be a voice of Books on Tape because of my reading voice.
Once more on voices, I have accidentaly impersonated the following voices: Alec Baldwin, Alan Rickman, Ian McKellen, Brian Griffin.

I have actually done this before. I cut off all ties that I had with people for two years, including my best friend that i had known for 10 years prior.

Life is too short to waste time and energy on matters that don't deserve it. If I don't have much to say it is because I am busy speaking in my mind. I will say what I want to say if it has to come out and keeping it in would have done me no better. I'm not going to torture myself nor should I care that my spoken inner thoughts should come under scrutiny or dismissal. I'm tired of my mind constantly going over the negatives of life and the negatives of seemingly insignificant things. If I should let go of all this negativity. I would like it to be right here and right now. Unfortunately life is not so simple.:frustrating: I already feel alienated, If I find myself withdrawing further from this world and from here, then that will be when I give up on myself and the world, that will be when all hope for me is lost. I will NOT let that happen. I am not going to let myself hurt others this way nor should I lose my integrity.

If I focus inwards, I get hurt. If I focus outwards I get hurt. Where is the higher ground here? how do you figure out a way to survive in this world, when you feel everything so greatly? it's like it's so much safer and easier to just be self absorbed.

I need to forgive the younger version of myself for being such a dumb bitch, and calling her a dumb bitch isn't the way to do that. I need to get in shape again. My best friend needs to get off my case and stop forcing me to date a guy i had no initial interest in, especially when I already had a heart to heart with myself about staying away from men for a while. Sorry that I don't want to date anyone and that makes you feel insecure because you are on the prowl MAJORLY for some odd reason.

I fell apart a while ago but finally I feel like I'm getting better. I'm becoming a little more confident, at least enough so that I don't beat myself up about everything, just about most things. (That's not much better I know.) Recently though I feel myself falling into depression and I don't know why.This shouldn't be happening. I have things to celebrate, but nonetheless I feel guilty. Guilty for not rooming with two people who wanted to room with me, guilty for not being able to make a decision, and guilty for having a babysitting job that pays well.

Sometimes I wish I could go back to the days when I tried to be like everyone else. It was easier copying them and having more ""friends,"" they weren't even real friends but they were people in the flesh that would talk to me. I'm different now, I'm too different for them, and for most people. I have a few good friends but I wish they didn't stare at me crazy for my ideas, and I wish I didn't feel like they were judging me all the time.

But, he is a pretty cool person who just wanted me to meet his wife and daughter for lunch, and the first thing that jumped out of my mouth was a lie so I wouldn't have to go.

Why did I do that? I get along just fine with the guy all of the time, and it isn't like I detest him or his choice of conversations. He's a rather interesting person, and even though I'm not as interested in meeting his daughter as he inferred I would, I feel despicable for not going.

You're welcome, wiona.

This reminds me of something i've wanted to say about this thread...
(On a separate note totally unrelated to you, Wiona)
I'm sure a lot of people are probably asking the question ""why do they need another place to whine"".
I make no apologies for the fact that many people here do not express things they need to, to people in their real lives. And I certainly make no apologies for those who think it is silly to express things that they are feeling. I really couldn't care less about what other people think. For their judgments are not my responsibility. I know what helps certain individuals, and I think they are entitled to it.

I saw a need, and I wanted to fill the gap. There are many people who would like to express something, but need a safe atmosphere in which to do it. Perhaps this is the safest atmosphere you are probably going to find, if you don't have someone you trust to talk to. I have read all the posts in here, and they have been of a genuine concern. I would not call them whining or pity seeking. And as someone who is learning to become part of the mental health community, I really do abhor these kinds of attitudes. Because often all it takes for an emotion to go away, is to express it. And having articulated it, then one can move on.

With this thread, I can only hope that individuals get the validation they desire, and to find a commonality in experience; A shared experience of what makes us human. I would also hope that if someone is in the position to help another, or finds something particularly relatable, they would initiate contact and engage in an open dialogue.

I personally don't sense negative energy, but maybe that's just me :wink: I hope some of these negative 'connotations' of self expression, which are culturally constructed, can one day be exposed for what they are (purely manifestations of broader social values), and we rectify our behaviour accordingly. Until then, social values can get f***** in my books. They serve none of my needs, and don't align with anything I have learnt or come to believe. I make no apologies for not aligning myself with social attitudes.

Thanks everyone for participating."

Wiona, except for confession no. 2 (I too, have been a chronic liar - and I'm trying to change that. It's such a horrible thing, yeah? I was like that too. I'm getting better, I think) I think the rest are not flaws at all but really cool traits that make you stand out from the crowd.

More often than not, the people who argue these things are those who do not wish to listen, and those who cannot rationalise/empathise how other people think and feel and therefore cannot accept that other people are different from them.

And moreover, just because you express something, doesn't mean you're not going to do anything about it. Sometimes that expression is the first step in the first place.

Hi Unnursvana,

I'm Asian and I would like to say that Asian people aren't all that innocent either. Do you know what we call white people? In the Cantonese dialect, we call them ""Gwei-lo"" in other words, ""Devil People"" or ""People who are devils"".

We call black people, or indians or anyone of a darker skin tone ""Hak-kuai"" or, ""Black devil"".

And these racist terms are not used as slurs, but in every day conversation.

In the country I'm from - Malaysia, our lifestyles are informed by racism. A lot of upper middle class families, usually Chinese and Malays, hire domestic workers from Indonesia and pay them very, very little. And a lot of them aren't allowed out of the house because they might ""run away"" or get a boyfriend or something. They're kept like prisoners in the house. And Indonesians in general are looked down on in Malaysian society even though they work 10,000x harder than a lot of people.

Indians are also targets of racism in society, mainly due to their low socio-economic status. The post-colonial landscape of politics, economics and social relations led to the Indian community being marginalized. Therefore, they have the stigma of being ""lower class"" and such attached to them.

In Malaysia, a HUGE part of the beauty and cosmetics industry derives its profits from Skin Whitening products (yes, you read it correctly - Skin Whitening Products).

A confession: when I was thirteen, in high school, I tripped and fell while playing during recess. An Indian friend grabbed my hand to help me up. I just flinched automatically when his skin met mine. I hate myself for that, hate myself so badly.

And I find it difficult to feel attracted to girls, the darker their skin tone is. And I find white girls more appealing than girls of other races. I don't like being this way because it makes me feel like an (for lack of a better term) emotional fascist because it's such a shallow, hollow perception of beauty. And it's also very degrading for white girls themselves, because it objectifies them.

This world is crazy, this world is gone.

This is a warning, a gun to the head thing. This is a sign; a don't-get-out-bed thing.

Here is a film that may give you a peek into my country. It's a short independent film made by one of those artsy fartsy people you find in cafes talking about the meaning of life. It's part of a series of films made by the same people:

INFP,"My love life or lack thereof:

I can't imagine anybody loving me/being truly interested in me in a romantic way. I feel like the more a guy gets to know me, the more I expose myself, the less he will like me.* I'm alternately too aggressive, too strange, too scared, have too many self-confidence issues, too incompetent and I'm frequently unable to articulate what I think and feel, so he'll see me as stupid and won't respect me (or maybe I am just that dumb). Also, I'm sure that that I may look somewhat pretty very occasionally, the more someone sees me, the less attractive I'll become.

I've been asked out a few times in my life but I'm very sure that they didn't really know me - I never said yes because I've been so afraid to expose myself to someone else like that and, plus, I felt nothing for them. The only time I've ever been attracted to someone was this guy who sat in front of me in grade 11 English - I couldn't take my eyes off him and I resented the hell out of him because of that (in fact I wanted to bash his head in haha). I mean, only once in 22 years? Some big part of me doubts that I'll ever find someone or that I'll ever have any strong feelings for someone. Plus I have this romantic streak in me (as much as I like to think I'm a realist) that won't let me settle. Oh well, at least I can be a crazy cat lady

(*actually, I feel like with most relationships - even here on PerC, I'm so afraid that most people don't like me and want me to shut up. I actually have to tell myself that I have no idea what the rest of you think of me, so I should just post irregardless.

i'm always so paranoid that people secretly don't like me and want me to just shut up-even my closest friends i worry they secretly just want to get away from me, there was a time when i was over that for awhile but then people started telling me i was to""real"" i'd just jump right into the deep emotional issues-because thats all i really think about. like on here i'm always thinking""why am i not friends with you guys"" i have no clue what you guys think of me, but i think you guys are super cool. i get a crush on a girl on here pretty much once a day."
INFP,"The past few days have been an emotional roller coaster. Yesterday, I was volunteering my time, sitting in front of a computer in a cubicle filling out spreadsheets. I felt very lonely and isolated:sad:, the fact that I was not properly eating and was hungry contributed to the feeling of emptiness that I had. An ENFJ who works there (and is good at lifting my spirits) gave me a hug before she left since it was her last day before her vacation. I immediately felt elated and turned very hyper as I continued to happily type into the computer (it has been over a month since I have been hugged):happy:. As time had passed, so did my energy and elation, felt drained and sad again :sad:. Then two emails from PerC: *You have a friendship request* and *New private message*:happy::happy:!! I went home and straight to bed afterwards, and woke up to find that I couldn't remember where I wallet was:sad:. That alone drained my energy to the point of sluggishness and made me lie in bed all day. I had then found my long lost watch while looking for my wallet:happy:, which I had then immediately misplaced after finding my wallet.. I'm glad that office has cubicles so they can hear my voice and not see my face as they can read me like an open book if I'm not too careful.

Hi Unnursvana,

I'm Asian and I would like to say that Asian people aren't all that innocent either. Do you know what we call white people? In the Cantonese dialect, we call them ""Gwei-lo"" in other words, ""Devil People"" or ""People who are devils"".

We call black people, or indians or anyone of a darker skin tone ""Hak-kuai"" or, ""Black devil"".

And these racist terms are not used as slurs, but in every day conversation.

In the country I'm from - Malaysia, our lifestyles are informed by racism. A lot of upper middle class families, usually Chinese and Malays, hire domestic workers from Indonesia and pay them very, very little. And a lot of them aren't allowed out of the house because they might ""run away"" or get a boyfriend or something. They're kept like prisoners in the house. And Indonesians in general are looked down on in Malaysian society even though they work 10,000x harder than a lot of people.

Indians are also targets of racism in society, mainly due to their low socio-economic status. The post-colonial landscape of politics, economics and social relations led to the Indian community being marginalized. Therefore, they have the stigma of being ""lower class"" and such attached to them.

In Malaysia, a HUGE part of the beauty and cosmetics industry derives its profits from Skin Whitening products (yes, you read it correctly - Skin Whitening Products).

A confession: when I was thirteen, in high school, I tripped and fell while playing during recess. An Indian friend grabbed my hand to help me up. I just flinched automatically when his skin met mine. I hate myself for that, hate myself so badly.

And I find it difficult to feel attracted to girls, the darker their skin tone is. And I find white girls more appealing than girls of other races. I don't like being this way because it makes me feel like an (for lack of a better term) emotional fascist because it's such a shallow, hollow perception of beauty. And it's also very degrading for white girls themselves, because it objectifies them.

This world is crazy, this world is gone.

This is a warning, a gun to the head thing. This is a sign; a don't-get-out-bed thing.

Here is a film that may give you a peek into my country. It's a short independent film made by one of those artsy fartsy people you find in cafes talking about the meaning of life. It's part of a series of films made by the same people:

I know all of that, I know there is hate and racism everywhere not just within the white people society and I know that black and Asian are racist to us too... I have seen it but it just bugs me. That is all. That was the main thing that I was trying to express. It was just because of these people at work who act like that, that I felt the need to say this because I can't do it at work. They just laugh at me and I can't seam to be able to pull of an angry face most of the time, I just tend to smile when I honestly want to yell at them and tell them that this is not right. I have honelsty gone home crying because I just think that they and the whole world is just so cruel.

I am sorry if you were offended in any way about my post."

Indeed. In Spanish the adage ""Moros en la costa"" means there's trouble ahead, though the sentence literally translates to ""Muslims on the coast""; it's because the north coast of Morocco and the south coast of Spain are so close together that many Moroccans immigrate to Spain because they live in poverty in Morocco.

I live in Denmark and we have quite a number of illegal immigrants. They're put in asylum centers, which are basically comfortable prisons. They aren't allowed jobs or education and many get mentally ill. It's because of a political party in our government who're nationalists, though they're kinda racist; they're just very good at hiding it. I hate politics! And democracy - democracy has never existed. ""Democracy"" means ""rule of the people"", but all we can decide as people in a representative democracy (which is the kind of democracy in all democratic countries except Switzerland, if I remember correctly) is to pick one out of a few people who has money enough to promote themselves and a sufficiently strong desire of having power that they're willing to go through all that shit it takes to get so far. And all the people who's been elected don't represent the people of the country, they only represent people like themselves. And the entire system is so stupid. Rules, control, oppression.. They even decide what plants people are allowed to grow. They try to protect people from themselves like people aren't able to do that. They decide what is ""correct"" behavior and what is ""incorrect"" behavior. They claim to be liberal, socialistic, conservative, etc but the only criteria they decide from is what they should do to keep having power, not what they believe is best for the people..

Sorry, this turned out to be a long rant. Well, you've read it now and you can't un-read it so have a nice day :happy:"

Sometimes I feel like the world is so cruel that I just don't want to life in it, I just want to get away to a faraway galaxy where everyone could life in harmony... I want to find that utopia.

This world makes me so sad and depressed sometimes. I hate how we judge people based on there looks, there skin-color, how there eyes are shaped, what language they speak or from what country they come from. They can't help it if they are black, they can't help it if they come from Canada or speak Russian and they aren't bad people if they come from these countries or any other country. (these were just an examples)

Just because some people from that country are stupid or mean doesn't mean that EVERYBODY from that country is. We are all individuals and sometimes we can't help the way we speak or think, it is in our culture or something,just deal with it. We can never avoid racism and everyone uses some racism sometimes but still... it makes me sad.

I hate my job, I work with people who judge people by there looks all the time, maybe they just do it because I care about these things and they like to see me worked up and I just smile at them when I really want to shout at them to shut up and stop being so narrow mined. Calling Asian People rice and stuff like that or talking about some black people having the typical black look or something. It makes me so sad that they do it. It isn't funny at all, it is just so cruel and narrow minded to say that. You are not any better just because you are freaking white person. Makes me wanna cry.

and if you are wondering, this is comming from an white girl. (just felt the need to say this)

People like that are just pathetic horrible people. I didn't realise that kind of racism still even existed. I mean, usually when I see people being racist they usually have a motive (Like thinking foreign workers are stealing their jobs etc) but to be racist towards someone just because of how they look. That's just awful. I would say something, if it's eating you up inside that badly definitely say something to them. Or if they don't listen every time they make a racist remark make a racist remark about them. Maybe then they'll see how stupid it is."

If it was that easy. One vs many is not good. And sometimes it's a cultural thing. Like the Football Worldcup now. Yes you can find soccer uniteresting and stupid but what cha gonna do? Start an argument with every fan in town? Unlikely.

Yeah when I was in eastern Germany before 1990 when the two halves reunited I could not believe that I'd be living in Ireland now. Things I take for granted like thermostats on the heating elements in the room are not there. The built quality in general is shit. The water is full of chlorine and gives you digestive problems when you drink it. The area is full of litter. Unlike in Germany public waste bins only exist in some spots so people here just drop the packaging when they are done with it. Living here for some time I kind of can filter this out and get used to it. Still I know that things can be done better and are done better in many places in the world. But I feel helpless in doing anything about it. There are so many issues to address I don't know where to start."

INFP,"Brothers and sisters, I am struggling. Last semester, see, I fell really in love for the first time, with someone who actually had feelings for me back. I had a relationship for the first time. I could be affectionate and romantic with someone completely for the first time. I drowned my ego (by which I mean self) in a sea of devotion and love for this person. I know she loved me in her way, but whether she admits it or not, she was using me the whole time, in multiple ways. She demanded monogamy of the sort that I wasn't even supposed to look at anybody else, yet she was smitten with someone else the whole time she was with me.

Then I fell into something with an INTJ. Simultaneously she was strong-willed and desiring of me to dominate her. She was so intense and so fast-paced that I was a little scared of her. I forgot to breathe with her. I liked her so much. I did her a great disservice by going out with her and agreeing to be in a ""relationship"" so soon. I just didn't know what to do. My head was spinning and I was trying to get Ego back, and here she was.

I'm ridden with guilt, shame, woe, and confusion. Two relationships, lasting less than six months, are my first relationships. It's repulsive and it's not who I want to be.

Additionally, yesterday, I had great Chinese food, but Straterra (ADHD med) - induced acid reflux made me vomit it all back up. :crazy: And I haven't slept well in weeks. And I am not taking care of myself, not exercising."

i take littering very seriousily,i'm always on peoples case bout not littering and recycling at my school but people just take it as a joke, the jocks(who i hate btw)alwasy litter so much and they jsut think it's a joke,trying to toss things intothe garbageand laughing when they miss-people just think ""out of sight, out of mind""they're dumb really"
INFP,"I was going to post something about racism and littering because these are subjects close to my heart XD but I don't think I can add anything interesting to the subject.

Just wanted to post something a bit positive. I saw a friend I hadn't seen in a while tonight. The last couple of times I had seen her didn't go too well. I've been friends with her for about 10 years now and we were generally pretty similar: both introverted, very imaginative, creative, idealists... but recently she has become a lot more social and honestly part of me felt jealous. I thought we were starting to grow appart. When I saw her today, I didn't feel any of those things, and I'm glad. We still have a lot in common and she's actually more introverted than she likes to lead on.

I thought about it on my way home, riding my bike with a cold breeze and a couple of rain drolets (haha what am I talking about again? oh right!) and thing is I'm tired of being ashamed for being introverted, I shouldn't have to! I feel like I haven't let myself be in a ''daydream'' mode in such a long time and now's a good time to start embracing it.

This post is kind of ..uhm not organized but I think my original idea was to thank this forum. Seeing other people like me made me realise I don't have to hide who I am and that I should just embrace it and be confident.

Enjoy this sudden positive thinking folks because it probably won't last very long knowing myself XD"

And it's not a good thing.

And I wish I could do something to take your pain away. I really do wish I could make things better for you.

I'm sorry that the world is racist - I say sorry, because I know I've contributed to that racism. And racism hurts you.

If I post a status update about anything deep (being stuck in an existential rut, analyzing psychological motives, etc) no one responds. It sucks, because when I'm posting such things, I'm usually at my worst and legitimately need someone to talk to.

On the other hand, if I post about something commonplace (For example, mine today: Courtney ____forgot how much she loves Monk. Seriously.), I can get several ""likes"" and comments.

I'm not sure if it's just that people value simplicity, or if superficiality is playing a major role.

I think social networking sites like Facebook were supposed to be all about bringing people together people who like the same things. Such sites were probably meant to degrade itself as it grows. It would probably be hard to notice what a given person says on your wall when you have 100+ ""friends"" and I emphasize that word. I made the mistake of giving a damn about whether people cared or not there. Facebook is shallow, so I treat it as such. I only play games there and that's about it. I mentioned this somewhere else, it was that Facebook had people who knew me in real life, and that when I had pleaded for help in supporting a cause of mine; it had fallen on indifferent and deaf ears as no one answered, not a single person. I had brought I had brought the same plea for help here in PerC and so many of you had gone above and beyond the call of duty to help me despite the fact that I have never met any of you in real life, I think that alone reveals who your ""friends"" are. If you are at your worst, in a rut, and need somebody to talk to, this is the place to be, this is my Facebook. roud: (It's such a shame the office computers filters PerC and not Facebook because it's labeled as ""Social Networking"":dry

Anyways, to my original thought. I feel terrible at the fact that I haven't been here often in the past few days. Things come up and suddenly I find myself away from the computer for far too long. Well, that's not necessarily a bad thing. BUT, this place has been good to me and I feel heavily obligated to return the favor, I feel I should contribute to this place further with more meaningful post to post count ratio. I'm going to try to put as much of myself into what I write each time I post here at PerC. That way, I will feel as if I deserved it should I ever become a VIP member here at PerC. I really need to be here more often, and I really need to get back in touch with the only person I've talked to here at PerC, it feels like it's been far too long and I don't want to leave you hanging.

I know how you feel. My first gf was the best thing that ever happened to me. I loved her so much. But she used me. Then she broke up with me and told everyone in my class it was because I was violent towards her and forced her into having sex with me (which of course is not true; I'd rather kill myself the most painful way possible than I'd do that!). Additionally she had one of her friends send me a death-threat in a text message. While breaking up with me she told me that I had become mentally unstable and stuff like that. And I actually believed her and apologized, begging her to take me back :angry:"

I like your comparison there. You could call most reality tv shows, the 'audio visual STIs' of society'. That, and parliamentary question time and infomercials.

I wish it was all that easy. I wish there was some kind of magic key that makes my dreams come true with just one click...
I wish you damn kissed me!

INFP,"I'm tired of people telling me ""you'll find your niche"". It's embarrassing and doesn't make me feel comforted whatsoever. I'm starting to believe I'll never figure out what I want to do. There's too many options, too many different paths I want to follow, and it leaves me frustrated. I wish I was one of those kids who had some amazing talent or knew what they wanted to do when they were 18... maybe I could have been more successful by now. 24...shouldn't i have figured things out by now- at least a career path."

INFP,"I can't even express how upset I am now. My family has been doing out best to take care of my great-aunt - she's had to be moved to a nursing home and there have been all sorts of issues. She is the closest (in sentiment) family relative we have outside our immediate family - I have been to Vienna with her, I've stayed at her place for weeks to watch operas with her and to help her out. She was invaluable to my parents when we were growing up. She's strong willed and intelligent and awesome.

Another family relative of ours called us golddiggers because we're trying our best for her. To have our integrity and actions and our feelings towards her questioned to that degree is heartbreaking. If you knew my family, you would see that we have integrity and idealism and respect coming out of our fucking ears and we love my great-aunt so much.

Honestly, this makes me so incredibly sad. I can't stop crying."
INFP,"
*hug* Probably that bile came out of guilt for not doing so much themselves. I'm sorry your great-aunt is having such trouble. Stay strong, friend."
INFP,"
*hugs* from me too. This is just so awful.. stay strong we're here with you. Screw what the rest of your family thinks, the important thing is that you know what your intentions are. I hope your great-aunt will be alright, and your family as well"

I agree, I once had a friend who told me that I used her so she would give me rides.. I told her I offered her money a couple of times and I asked her if she minded but she always said no to both. She got mad and we're no longer friends.. Meh I didn't lose much she was hoimophobic and I hear she tried out to be an escort recently.. She never really listenend to me so I'm glad I don't have to try anymore for us to be friends."
INFP,"Sometimes I wonder about the decision I made. I mean, I knew that by choosing this persony that I was accepting that I had changed. I was accepting that I had a new life and that this is what would make me happy. And I am. I'm more free and able to do and think as I choose with no judgements. But there are times when I question why you choose to keep me around. I fear that you have secret intentions and really, that you are just waiting for the perfect moment to hurt me. I'd be lying if I didn't say that I'm just waiting for you to hurt me. You are perfect. But you're afraid. You're afraid because it'd be too serious. You're afraid because you know that you'd just hurt me in the end. Even I know that in this city and where we are in life - that well, you'd hurt me. And it's a shame because we have so much in common. And it's a shame because I've let you in probably more than anyone else that I've ever encountered. You genuinely try to make me laugh and you do (and want to do) all the things that I've ever want to try or do or go and see and eat. So, I don't know what we are. I torture myself trying to figure it out so much that I'm thinking I should move. And we live together! How ABOUT that? Let's just keep it complicated for giggles. And laughs? I wish you weren't afraid - because then I'd let that last wall down and I'd take care of you and love you like no one else ever will. I hate that you're so fun. I hate that we get along so well. I hate the inbetweeness. I might just leave one day and tell no one - I've always wanted to start over. I just kinda wish that I could go and start it over with you.:frustrating:

Why hasn't an iced coffee maker been invented? If so, why isn't it available to me? I think my common sense must be in fantasy land too because I didn't bother to even google ""iced coffee maker"" so any complaint I have made in this long run on sentence shall be ignored and nullified.


Is it bad that I was supposed to call my best friend 30 minutes ago so I could wake her up and we could go to the beach..but I don't want to yet.... I'm not ready to end my online time?


I wish more than anything I could play instrument. I love music! I really do. But I feel bad when I say I love it, because I don't know if I understand it completely.

Personally, I don't think I can just change overnight, and become a more driven, hard-working person. I think it takes time...it will take a long time. But I hope that when I've finally achieved what I want to achieve, you'll still be around.

And I hope by then, time wouldn't have made me so cynical as to make me hate you for not valuing me before; before I decided to change; for the vicissitudes of life are such that our past selves, our weak, lesser selves are only a twist of fate away from being unveiled again."

A few years ago my dad asked my what i wanted for chrismtas-isaid a bass guitar and he asked me""re you sure you'll use it"" and i said yes.i've played it twice and never bother beyond that-it makes me feel terrible i waster his money and that i gave up-again"

Ugh, I know how that feels.
I have a keyboard that my dad only bought for me because I was failing piano keyboarding (the instructor intimidated me, so I would spend 2-3 weeks on one song to get a perfect score, and so I was way behind everyone else) that I never really used after the class was over.
And an electric guitar that is pretty much just in my room for decorative purposes.
And my dad's first acoustic guitar, that I never play either.

Not being a J though, I can't bring myself to get rid of any of them.
I might play one of them at some point..."

INFP,"Stream of Conscious Mode! This is a long one...... (that's what she said)

Yesterday I was going for a walk downtown during my lunchbreak. Bad mistake on my part. I saw a couple that were roughly my age. They had their arms around each other. At that moment, it felt like something died inside of me. Things just got worse on my commute home. I became increasingly aware of all the couples around me. I remember posting about how I was a little uncomfortable (rather an understatement as I would scream about it in my head) about ""get a room"" moments, someone had then alluded that to having some sort of agenda against it. There is no agenda, no ulterior motive, less of a logical explanation, more of an emotional explanation. I've grown averse to seeing it because it HURTS me EVERY TIME. You may as well would have shoved a screwdriver into my stomach because that would be the physical version of what it's like. My stomach churns and clenches as I feel my energy and well-being leave me just at that moment. I stood in the train trying to take my mind off of it. I wanted to crawl into my bed and pull the covers over my head. I can't be like others and go ""Awww"" at a sight. I just can't. I feel like an impoverished child who sits on a bench only to spot a spoiled brat toss aside a lollipop after having a few licks of a lollipop. This would be one of the reasons why I don't want to go back to college at the moment. Having to deal with a forty minute commute back and forth. I've had some of my worst moments on a train ride home. That was when I started documenting my thoughts, that was when I just couldn't keep it in my head anymore. That was when I knew the meaning of emptiness. For a while now, I go to sleep with my arms wrapped around a pillow. It makes me feel more comfortable to know that there is something to hold onto at night, I found it hard to sleep without it when I was away from home. I would then sleep on my side with my arms folded across my torso, things feel slightly more colder, more isolated, more... alone. I would even reach for the pillow as a reflex when I felt that it wasn't nearby. My own body heat warms it, and thus it warms me in return as I fall into slumber. I suppose that's about as close as I'm going to get to that feeling of closeness to someone. I suppose it's just an illusion when you think about it. A self imposed delusion as a means to deal with the current state of things. I want to find someone, I guess that's what's going on right now, me wandering around the city aimlessly in search of something that is out of reach. There's also the possibility that I'll be doing this for the rest of my life: wandering in. Maybe I'm looking in all the wrong places, I may not find what I'm looking for. ""I won't get to get what I'm after 'til the day I die"". (I just had to quote The Who because I've been listening to The Seeker for the past couple of days XD)

I'm also perplexed by the members of PerC who say they don't look good or that they aren't photogenic. Only to show that there is nothing wrong with them, quite the opposite actually. Everyone does look nice. I'm further perplexed by the fact that I hold the same view on myself, I have a low perception of myself on camera. I wonder why is it that I always seem to look better in the mirror than I do on film? I hate seeing my face in photos. Why do I see myself like this!? Why am I torturing myself like this!? *sighs* I've lost 50 friggin' lbs. I should be friggin' proud of my friggin' self. YES!! I am TALL (6 ft. to be precise), DARK (black hair, drab colored clothing, was said to have a dark looming presence *good* uhh.... grim demeanor and expressions so yes, dark literally and figuratively *thumbs up*) and HANDSOME? (Well... a teacher, a librarian, a cousin's wife who's been married for 20 years, certain looks given from women who are much older than me... yeah... essentially people who I have no prospect of dating due to obvious reasons... :dry:great or maybe the ones my age are afraid to tell me..:dry:*friggin' great* now I have no way of knowing since that's the one aspect of non-verbal communication I'm not very good at). STRONG (YES!! along with height, I tower above my older brother and almost everyone else in my family, contributing to aforementioned dark looming presence). SILENT (duh, known as the ""one who doesn't talk"" by a classmates mom, appeared to have come out of nowhere at times, apparently very sneaky too). *Alright* Now I slightly feel better about myself now.... I really want to go back into bed right now. I also need better endings to these streams of consciousness. They all end too abruptly."
INFP,"I still think of this little girl I met in illinois she was only EIGHT years old and her father dropped
her off to the fair I was working and let her be there alone all day untill about 11 at night again she was EIGHT.
I made it my mission to make sure she was okay I let her play my game for free (without a prize) and all her friends too.She still had fun though,
I also told her to check in with me and she did.I felt horrible for her I wanted to kill her father for being a horrible parent.
I hope she's okay,I really do.I honestly while I was there was thinking about how I could adopt her or have my mom adopt her so she could have a better life I don't know it makes me so upset and sad when parents do things like that.
You need to watch your children.
Then when I was in indiana there was this little kid probably only four and wanted a 25 cent gumball the mom was like
""We just came here to get my nails done now shut up"" So I went over to the gumball machine and got him one : )
she was probably pissed I didn't care though If you can go get your nails done,you can get your child a gumball.
Obviously things like this really piss me off. : ("
INFP,"At times Ifeel that the world is a grim place that you can never escape. This past week has been very stressful, and its been a very long time since I recieved emotional support. My parents have been arguing lately; my father doesn't say anything about that but my mother shows no effort in hiding that, and all the time she has this grim expression that just tears me apart, and every time I try to console her she dumps all her emotional load into me, creating a huge burden that makes me want to explode.
I look out into the world, and all I see is lack of emotions as people have become very skillful at hiding it because it is considered a sign of weakness, making the people become so cold to the point of cruelty, you can see its extremities in wars, where the human life has no value anymore.
That's why I like PerC, 90% of all the emotional support I got was from this place (and I signed up about 5 months ago!) and I sincerely thank everyone on this forum for it. This has been the only place that I could speak freely of my introversion and all my other ""not normal"" traits without being criticized. Once again I thank you all."

Add to this all the girls i liek are introverts so i can rule out them coming to me to try and be friends, Extroverts might be easy but i just find them to normal,or they seem so content that i can't imagine them having a use for me. all the cliche they ask for apply to me:honest,kind,caring,polite and funny but it still dosen't make a difference. confidence is the one thing i'll always lack.."

I just want someone I can confide in. Someone who I know I can rely on. Who I can be for and who will be there for me.

It probably doesn't help that I get so attached to my online friends. Because sadly, I'm probably never going to meet most of them. And most of them will find partners or go on to college/uni and probably forget about me.

I make such an effort to make friends with people and they just never make the effort back. It just makes me feel like I've done something wrong.

I can empathise with that completely! Well, except the online friends part. i'm not that tecchy T_T

you haven't done anything wrong. I guess most people are like that. And they probably don't know they're making you feel terrible. meh it's their problem, not yours they're missing out on an awesome awesome friend.
(you know actually, maybe INFPs are doing it wrong, because i get that problem too. we need a friend-making tutorial!)

and i'm sure you'll find someone sooner or later! i don't usually say this, because i know it's impossible for me to tell. But you seem to be a really thoughtful and romantic and likeable person and that's just from a little post! you WILL get a great friend eventually.

i'm trying to make friends too. Good luck let us embark on an epic journey together to make new friends!

oh, i forgot to add :x
i get lonely a lot too. But I guess it's all part of being human. The loneliness actually makes me feel more connected to people, because i know that i'm... alive and... feeling and all that. haha was that weird :x
